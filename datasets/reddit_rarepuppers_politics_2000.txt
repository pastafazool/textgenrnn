Apologies to all my fans who been expecting a hit 
I had some real life issues come up to be dealt with a bit 
then i dropped twenty pounds  to pretend I was sick 
asked for Mook  and hoped no one would remember this shit 

This gon  be different  Flex  I hope you warned your team 
A sad look  and I put that on everything  that s the Jordan meme 
I came out west to say some shit that's sort of mean 
so you gon  get killed at home by a dickhead  like that Clockwork Orange scene 

See  I already love this city  More than facts 
My bro Daylyt showed me all the best spots to get restraining orders at 

I said   It's cool  you ain't gon  do me no harm 
A  roid rage the only time you'll see a mad flex shooting them arms 

But fuck the jokes  Just keep a distance when we rapping 
 cause I paid some cholos off that'll split you into fractions 

Think ticket sales   cause if you fuck wit me  it's a killing 
give me limited space  and you gon  get a buck fifty in the building 

They like   E  that's how you punchin   It's too soon  
True  This shit I bottles up's a trip  like huffing on poop fumes 
plus a bar from MadFlex that's more than nice is sort of like an orange slice 
you getting it once in a Blue Moon 

I give a fuck what this douche bag fool packages 
Your crew's faggots  a fruit salad  it's too saddening 
and if your dudes acting true savages 
I'll Facebook spam you a few battles and
have you scared to remove tags like new mattresses 

Look  it don t matter if y all with the shit Flex brought 
As far as a Fresh Coast fit  you're equivalent to wet socks 
You probably spent this week sitting at your desktop 
trying to get hype while giving yourself pep talks and listening to Plex Rock  
Meanwhile  I been whipping up a fresh pot 
The way I'll son you s different  I ain't kidding  I'm your step pops 
Like midgets serving top shelf liquor how you'll get stopped 
 cause the bar's been set so high that you can t even hit me with your best shot 

So  I don't want to hear no shit that end with  Eas z y  E  
You got to go crazy  thinking out your right mind's your only chance of seeing me 

And yo  that shit was fucking nice 
I'm breaking down your thought process 
 cause the right side of your brain's what makes a vision come to life 

And you could Ask Jeeves if you ain't ever known 
the shit I bring smarter  King Arthur  if you got a point to set in stone 

get taken out  I m nicer wit the quotes 
It ain't an issue to get Mad shelved when everything he s writing is a joke 

I could ve said  magazines   like clips that jam 
since I'm known to pop punks but got a Simple Plan
to have you looking stupid over nothing nutting  quicker than a minute man 
You just gon  stand there and give me the win   cause you my biggest fan 

Yo  round one  we ain't gotta discuss it 
I swear that was my lightest shit  Well  actually  it probably wasn t 

MADFLEX
Shouts to the vets ducking that battle with Flex 
Real Deal said financially it has to make sense 
but he might shut that shit down in your class if you're ten 
I know  you making big moves  Trevor  we won't ask you again 
Hey  fuck him  I picked a writer that I had to respect
and brought him out to the West  That's not true  I have to confess 
I came to see if a virgin could have a dad bod  and the answer is yes 
The man ain't a threat 

Like I'd have a hot battle
with a dude who'd eat a condom full of heroin  and then not travel 

Look at you  You still booking through false bravado 
and I wasn't askin Avo to talk to Hollow 
but every time I hit up G's it was  followed by silence  it was not staccato 
They don't get it  Weak today  hot tomorrow 
Most of what I spit go over heads  I'm Triple H with that water bottle 

so try to follow  But we building a classic 
like   Nah  fuck that  you sound better when you absent 
Get cracked and do the math  then flush it down the toilet 
it's no portable TheSaurus girl  I came to put this whole card on the canvas 
Boy  you  bout to get your ass kicked  Get ravaged  one jab clip
turn him around quicker than walkin by a bad chick 

You don't have shit  Nah  Fuck You  you see low green Cee Lo Green  
He ll catch the first 48 from my last three 16's 
Add it up  You wack as fuck 
You need to give me more space than some JNCO jeans 

You ain't been killing shit like I've been 
Women's bathroom  go ahead and freshen up  fuck how hot the line is 
Tread light  and get a grip though  you been out of alignment 
I follow E F with that G check  I ain't alphabetizing 

This is second nature 
You always got some mark down watch like a jealous neighbor 
but the cliche suits you  that's the yellow ranger 
Don't get in danger  Keep pitching these bitches that less is greater
and watch him hit the floor so many times  now you an asshole on an elevator 
…And I wrote that before Money Bagz  he no showed  To hell with haters 
I still miss Caddy  Show up like Will Smith cabbie 
Eyeball that Fresh plate  everyone in yo' home smell you later 

I'm nice 
Thank you  I need that rack   cause  that's your cue to break out 
 cause you ain't solid enough for stripes 

Fuck your life  I struck the light under the butane for him 
Veruca Salt round  dude can fall down with these goose eggs on him 
You ain't near my level  pipe down  but you ain't warpin 
No arrogant talk back  from the best Eric in Talkback  
Ah  Farrell feral   That's a starved cat  Man  you ain't Foreman 
If these words hit a nerve  it ain't a toothache forming 
This is not a drill  Lets get back to the root  Wait for it 
Dolla dolla bill  I'm back building with my face forward 
 cause a dollar bill got a building on the back and a face forward 
You like that 
The lesson of the day going  don't show up to the game if you ain't scoring 
Man  I keep hearing E pushing keys  I mean  maybe  do you play organ 
Like  what  you got  haymakers for neighsayers   If you train horses 
you pay for it  I corpse him with a Liu Kang horsekick 
Fuck around and it won't matter if the shoe game horrid 
I boot his lip  the 12 wings turn to the Flu Game Jordans 

What up  Spice Rack  Nah  me and you  the pay grade ain't the same rate 
Book club  I just got to make sure we on the same page 
 cause all your punches hit  but they whip before they nae nae 
Start buttin  in  I could start button him  and save this played game 
Believe me  uh bulimia   I put a lot of time into this straight waste 
I didn't want to work this out in my house 
but I d look so fucked up if I skipped you  this is Leg Day 
Good luck man  don't get your shit kicked off of the main page 

Round Two
E  FARRELL
I took this matchup  cause you got a fire pen 
I mean  to me your writing s number one  on a scale of fucking five to ten 
They say you like a white Passwurdz with the style  when
you more like an incorrect password  check your caps lock and try again 

It's tiring how you cramming your rhymes 
A flight delay when you write that way   cause shit ain't landing on time 
We see you ramble on lines
and try n meet today 2 day  s standard with a rushed delivery like Amazon prime 

I know your flow's the core of how you open doors 
but when these leagues got feeling you under pressure 
kinda like the ocean floor 
you need to punch with conviction  focus more 
 cause when you choose to speak it's a nudist beach 
you nowhere no wear  close to sure shore  

You ain't suited up to play here  I m better 
Plus  you did your last three matchups in this format  and that ain't very clever 
You should learn to change gears whenever 
 cause the point of going Back to Basics isn't just to fucking stay here forever 

That's why you should shut your mouth 
I got a punch for every Cali match you had no one gave a fuck about 

So those that ducked you probably got a point 
Why test Flex   ability in this dis  location 
when he proved that he can't get it popping in the joint 

And I hope you thought that shit was soft 
I wrote a flex ability bar just  cause I know how much they piss you off 

See  disrespect s what I'm  bout 
I once battled Cortez and choked the whole time 
just so the footage wouldn't ever come out 

I m different  See  Flex cool  but I was best left off alone 
and since this corn rose rows  to the occasion 
if he get it twisted here hair   I'll knot his dome 
I ll tell him   Watch how u talking  homes  
 cause dog'll get a two piece in his mouth
like the sunscreen bottle if he cop a tone Coppertone  

Life's a beach  I ll catch you trying to kick up your feet in sand 
and pull up in the Jeep wit some big shit to sweep the land 
Even if you bring the pigs  I ma get to meet meat  with cans  like eating spam 
sock a soccer  bitch and let it kick over green  that's Mia Hamm 
I know because we seasoned fans  it seems we fam 
I'll tell you that I need a hand  then have you flying from a hook  you Peter Pan 
We should at least had planned to put up each a grand 
 cause I ain't got to post my Don't Flop battles in Talkback to see a band banned  

At this point  killing all y'all is too necessary 
Facts fax   I'm getting paper for the principle principal   school secretary 

Charge a rack for a mixtape feature 
You should probably take notes from the kid like a fifth grade teacher 

Anyone who think I'm Stephen Curry getting thirty d by Flex
is talking crazy out the ass  Eddie Murphy in Shrek 

Round two  I ain't came for classic 
I put Brian in a box 
like a guy whose name was Brian died and eventually was placed in a casket 

MADFLEX
Putting this cub scout on the thug route  was whose decision 
Was it you  Come get him  I'll wait  I'm used to chillin 
like    Any bark   n  E   N E   heart break  that's New Edition 
Your moms mastered the science of fucked up genes jeans   that's True Religion 
Schemes  but I don t buy it  he lose commission 
Get through the mission 
I know Bad Dudes  you know Shaq Fu  We moving different 
Tell Avo this shit is Roscoe s  I'm through with chicken 
He spent his life as a proven victim  ya'll knew the symptoms 
and y all react to his fake ass punches  Fuck ya'll  Two for flinching 
I'm too efficient 
Look  do I choke  No  You get bars  til you stop  I use submissions 
I got goons to kick in
and  pop  put money under a pillow  you'd think a tooth is missing 
Boom  hit him  Mix the jab cross with the shoe position
 til that hook follow a tackle  and I ain't tuna fishing 
I'd supply some good advice if you would listen 
They just got to add a little paper to cook E cookie   that's Confucianism 
At this point  I'm just fooling with him 
Call up Dot and let that  um Berretta  open up in his house 
like   we ain't worried  bout superstition  
Eric  I fuck with you… Youtube  ll get it 
I fuck with you  but you a mild substitute  a euphemism 
I got charm  n Charmin  wipe my ass with fabrications you have written 

Truth to fiction  Spice Rack  go hold down the herbs 
but I'm known round the world 
and you known  cause Bangz louder than a comb down with a curl 
He say he pop Molly   He will throw down with a girl 
and you can pick up the pieces 
Tell this chump I want some background funk  we playing Toejam and Earl 

Look at me  dork 
The hands come out for a broken man down  it ain't the peace corps 
You leave  or get hammered in a trunk  now you a tree fort 
What the fuck you want it with me for 
when you looking as uncomfortable as you without a keyboard 
and hella squares on his side like Nike Elite shorts 

I got messages for squares  so  grab a Post it 
It's just a little light when you snap  that's a glow stick 
Who you roll with 

What  Ya'll break my shell for the cream like crab chowder 
That coward couldn't break news if he was Matt Lauer 
Flex  rap game Jack Bauer 
No Chilla Jones shit  like  tear a wrist when Mad counters  
it just takes a week to learn what I've done in the past hour 
Keep the soda  Teach him yoga  dog posing flat downward 
You'd get caught if you got into dirt  that's warning track power 

Relax  There ain't no reason to score this match 
Just upload the shit to YouTube with a corpse attached 

I'm so beyond  I mean  you know me  Obi Wan   cause I can force the hand 
I'm through with this moving through duplicates   cause this ain't Orphan Black 
and I ain't holding back without a torture rack 
A single punch ravage through his body and transform a cat 
and Ravage a Transformer cat  so when I say transformer  facts 
But if i spoke like you  it's  fayacts  
But when I say transformer  facts 
 cause first it meets the eye  then you get more than that 

Motherfucker  now you die  and I d bet one or two lives
that you ride with a bank account balance that fucking matches your shoe size 
In summary  Eric  your mama should ve got her tubes tied 
Fuck you  guy 

Round Three
E  FARRELL
I got a story that might just make your day   It might not  either  
One time I faced a j  then hit the club to sip some Tanqueray 
I threw my balls at your bae bay  like the A's came to play 
She didn't didn't shut my game down  just covered all bases  that s a rain delay 

Translation  homie  I got drunk as shit and fucked your bitch 
I m kidding  I just got drunk as shit and let her suck my dick 

She even topped the whole squad off  cause she likes the whips we drive 
Before she left  everyone was blew Blue   Eifell 65 

Fuck your life  That's some shit I m hating on 
 cause to me  son ain't really that bright  out here trying to break a don of dawn  
Its like as a baby  you was dropped by your crazy mom 
and your head had taken more hits than my favorite bong 

But you don't smoke pot  That got me really surprised 
this whole venue s stoned  bro  even the ceiling is high 

Real rap  I bet you're prolly mad at weed 
and think that being a pothead
will surround you with more fruits than fucking Johnny Appleseed 

See  getting fucked up's just something Flex don't need to write raps 
Pull a  joint out  he gon  look at you like Jesus Christ's back 
Go to spark it  he s like   please don't light that  
then he just might snap and kill the buzz like a Venus flytrap 

But try that here  I ain't gon  be the one thats laughing 
out of nowhere  I ma get it shaking with Flex  muscle spasm 

If I throw a left fist or right at homes  his nose  ll break 
Then he gon  feel right at home with a red bridge like the Golden Gate 

Yeah  Fuck stretching em wit a Ruger 
I ma take you to school  and then teach you a lesson like I'm your tutor 
like how Avocado booked this and CT s 3 hours ahead 
I'll be talking to a vegetable in the future 

Yeah  so you gon  lay with your frame broke 
I got a gun that spit so crazy  shit came with a raincoat 
and when I pop it at your face and your brain smoke 
your third eye could open up  but you ain t gonna stay woke 

I ain't trying to have Flex offended  just flex my pen 
 cause I got less than 10 bars  til we back to being friends again 

It's just sad I had to fuck up your movement 
Never should ve got Mad in the first place  like I jumped to conclusions 

They say my drive been watered down  that's a car pool 
But I think I still spit solid  that's hard drool 
If they said you heating up  it's just  cause you aren't cool 
Plus  all your punchlines are shit  you have bar stools   Boo  

I got bigger fish to fry  and Brian ain't an obstacle 
Now I got to stick with jokes like I ate a popsicle 
Plus  that MadFlex name is comical 
 cause you getting straight bodied  while I'm bending over backwards
just to make it possible 

I said I cared about this  I probably lied 
I just wanted free tickets to see Carter Deems live 

And that s still on the bucket list 
That's all for now folks  If MadFlex ain't at World Dom I ll be fucking pissed 

MADFLEX
 I don t want to be mean to you for another round  Eric  It s gonna go bad  
You came out here looking like the product of some one night stand with Absyrd 
 No  you don't understand  it gets worse  
You came out here looking like the product of some one night stand with Absyrd
did the fucking fusion dance with a Amber Alert 

That still ain't better than a no show 
I start attacking E  til plasma streaming from his head  wanna Go Pro 
then you curl up  and I leave on a high note like Soul Glo 

Frodo  this charity  I mean  it may be deductible 
These motherfuckers paid you in Lunchables 
Don't talk about money  If he do  don't trust this fool 
Lactose intolerance   cause you just got a little cream 
and it makes me uncomfortable 

Bump knuckles  we d catch a case like fuckin bellboys 
If you flex an arm connect  it is a frontal deltoid 
You got more goons in JeFF s Mustang than the one that fell Troy 
Cool  The whip next to the ratchet  shit  I'm Uncle Elroy 

You hear that  Get used to those 
It just happens when a true man show versus the Truman show 
Here's some shit that some of ya'll hoopers know 
He missed his shot  but he goes down no matter how you spin it 
What's that   Shooter s roll 
You a troll  You got  da feet  bars  I'd never use one though 
 cause I don't fuck around with da feet  boy  I'm in cruise control 
The usual  The 50 Super Bowl dumped roman numerals 

A K A  Take this L  you played yourself 
It's  let's work   til the network make a joke disappear 
this one here Dave Chappelle 

Well  you a little more Velma  Shaggy  Brennan Dassey 
I'm an athlete 
and Clark Kent came out the booth like   I thought I was half geek  
Half the room knows  Dan Larusso with the bad knee
is the only time in his life that he's seen somebody clap heat 
Now  I can't tell if you animated or anime  kid  your style is mad cheeks 
20 battles  I still ain't heard you to rap  E 
Get the picture  I tag E  Collapsing back teeth all hit the damn street 
He pick it up  pick it up  pick it up  that's Black Sheep 
I'm nasty  Fix the crib for your girl like Nick and Gatsby 
then your Boo ain't never leaving the house  it s Mr  Radley 

High school education bars 
You ain't a star  Farrell  Fuck rap  Your whole stack fit into a mason jar 
I lay a beat down until E sound like bass guitar 
You a shooter  No  You get Happy to play for par 
and you pay a goon or two to root for you cause you can't raise the bar 

Jackass  Nah  the care package void 
Get drilled for real  a southpaw to scare Pastor Troy 
You lack the poise 

I mean  you something that these squares can enjoy 
but you fronting in the hood so hard the airbag deploy 

You terrible  I throw my fist in just to fish from the bottom barrel 
This bull come to a close clothes  like the Rock's apparel 
I am not comparable 
You keep ignoring the cost  You Horrible  Boss 
I'll kill him  why you callin  Colin  Farrell 

This a waste of movement 
 cause you mixing in more fake drums than eighties music 
and I start to feel a hatred brewing 
I mean  it s Eas z y  E  and for the Record  it may be Ruthless 
But you not my cup of tea  cause the tables turned  that's a lazy Susan 
I hate these new kids 
They ain t proven  and they ain't seen shooting 
I got a gun in the safe with the safety safely rooted
and I did not bring the shit  I ain't gon  use it 

Look at him  You don't let the tech blast  I don't stress that 
True to form  Human Torch 
you  poof  hold your fire when you get mad  You get that 

Nah  Flex  that jabroni is Dellavedova to Kobe 
puttin  Goldberg the wrestler vers  Goldberg the goalie 
Dethrone me  Hoe  please  Your whole steez is dopefiend 
I'm so deep in the game even the old me was an O G 
White man flash  slap   red hand  don't crosswalk no streets 
Me and E trade  my stock too high  those seats come with nosebleeds 
I'm testing switchblades on resting bitch face  You the homie 
You the first person I'll tell when I tell  em that I got 0 3ed 
Eric I got 0 3ed 
Organik  if I'm not on World Dom than you can blow  
your money  elsewhere  it's your loss  O 

I said what's up homie  Welcome to your own lobotomy
You may have sent Dirtbag Dan back to local comedy but ain't no one stopping me
We are World Domination 6  right  The whole globe is watching
Ain't that about a bitch  Like a Rone biography

I said my dude  I'm honestly happy for you
I thought you'd never be the champ son
Shit  we six bars into this title match
and it's already better than the last one

I mean I'm way too advanced son I can do shit that you've never did
That's why I gotta take his last breath before he get a second wind
I mean I heard you was gonna get personal with me  I must've got in his head
Y'all been begging for a king but instead you got a God in the flesh

You want your style   your style  Is as obvious as it gets
You rap like how bitches talk to their pets
Like   Oh  you gon' rap like this is things you gotta handle
Oh  You gon' talk to Daniel like a Cocker Spaniel AARF 
Boy I catch you slipping on yo' campus while you flannel
Boy I gotta choppa knock you out your socks and sandals  

This so don't panic  your punches do no damage
I'll     turn your nose into nothing but bone fragments
Body blows  give him a bleeding heart like a hopeless romantic
I'm nomadic  I leave Earth with no hope of going home to my own planet
You my bro Adam but that don't mean I won't got at him
Throw blows at him  bury him up to his throat and throw stones at him

You get cold feet  I toe tag you
You know that chrome Magnum
But that forehead cro magnum
My bullets hit you ricochet and hit Gully and Organik

I said they keep calling you a king but I think this king needs the boot
I mean honestly this whole chain needs a control alt delete and reboot
This guy called me a fucking  weed  man
But I think we can see the truth
I think he's just jealous of the weeds at least weeds has some roots

I mean my dude  you dressed up like fucking Abraham Lincoln trying to gain some views
And then you rapped about freeing slaves while all the black people tried to escape the room
The craziest shit is
Out of all the angles this lame could use
It's funny you dress like Abe Lincoln but you're the one getting the chain removed

I'm way too smooth  you ain't never been great
Let's face facts Adam I'm already a legend today
But I swear to God the only thing black in your house is electrical tape
He probably calls the cops on his own shadow like   Stop him  He's getting away  

You're a fucking faggot with no stripes

You wanna gamble but no dice
This fool Adam is so white he won't even reach in his bars
He's had everything handed to him his whole life

I said  he'll out write me and then out white me
You don't want to mess with dude
He's never struggled a day in his life  his parents put him on a pedestal
He's got a top five but no non white rappers
He's got a tattoo right above his champ stamp that says #Alllivesmatter
He loves chai tea  tai chi
He hates Spike Lee  doing The Right Thing
He loves Skyping  typing  hiking  biking
The word  Reiching   evidence hiding  stereotyping  racial profiling
Pretty much any white thing

Homie   you ain't anything like me
You ain't prepped for survival
Cause a year from now  nobody's gonna remember when you went viral
You may have cheated death before with Illmac' but now your destination is final
We can all judge this book by this cover cause the story ends with the title

That's one BITCH 

Round 1
RONE
Roney Bae the King  formerly the prince
I call him  Cocker Spaniel  cause he's always been my bitch

Oh  so you're the super villain career ender
Well I dig that
I heard you even ended a marriage before  well that's a sick stat
But my rhymes change lives too  you doubt my impact 
Have you seen Big T lately  He's 170 with a six pack

World Domination
What  I gotta break him down geographically 
I mean Taiwan fucks with me
I guess I got that Taipei  type A  personality
I mean chickas want my Calvin's off
No strap to get my style across
Cause I rap like I got an Eagle that's the size of an albatross

I was whipping the drop Regal that's blacker than Don Cheadle
You're pall  Paul  bearer  the jaw  John  ring gon  Ring  say  shells these are not Beatles 
Do you like your pops leave you
Horror script and the plots evil
And I already killed you once  my stories don't got sequels

I'll run up on him like the Rocky steps
Slash him with a hockey stick
I killed him once  I gotta kill him again like he's a zombie flick

But there's no skeletons in my closet so this ain't another body
You're only as good as the dirt you have and you have nothing on me
I mean  I didn't cheat on my girl  not a whore in my house
But not because I have morals let me just dispel that lie now
And not because of love  let me shoot that right down
I didn't cheat cause I was scared fucking Caustic would find out

Fucking Sherlock Holmes

He bides his time  thinking he's kinda sly
Stealing receipts  checking what I would buy like some kind of private eye
But I got hip to the game quicker  we're not painting the same picture
'Kay wigger  There's a difference between a dirt digger and a grave digger

See  you're finished

Well   done stick a fork him
The mortician the 28 4 liter Ford engine
The unicorn I'm Porzingis in the form with it
I'm Ben Simmons on the floor spinning
A centaur while he's formed shifting but Caustic is just
Light and projection  it's pure physics

You had the same hair beard combo as every pussy at Coachella
So you can not be hard  it's a simple little fact
Plus you have the same voice as the pig from Toy Story
So it's only right I dump that nickle in his back 

Yo  I'll hit your niece with the braces
Get her tea bagged til her teeth snag  I'm her new dentist

You fuck with     I use her team flag as a skeet rag
I'll let the team shag
I could get half of your family tree bag
Your baby mom is 43  does speed and let's her jeans sag

Your baby mom looks like a drag queen  I'll get your queen dragged
Rip his beard off  do his Adam's apple like a speed bag
I don't care if Soul's punch was softer than a fucking bean bag
You got slapped and just stood there just like that shit was freeze tag

I mean  daaaaamn Daniel
I bet that pussy wet as dam Daniel
That pussy got man handled
He hit it then kick it out he told to go pan handle
Watch me grand stand you
{punching sounds} Van Damme you
{punching sounds} Damn Daniel you don't understand I'm snuffing your man's candle

Watch me back stab you  over and over again like the needle gone on a back tattoo
Check  check  Martin Havlat you
Fold him  zip him  knapsack you
Style on him  Rat Pack you
Whip my phone out  fucking battle and beat him then fucking Snapchat you

But wait  wait  wait  wait

Maybe  keeping it all rappity rap is keeping it too basic
So if I acted how you act  well how would you take it 
Cause if I was you  I would probably name your girl and call her  a hot mess 
If I was you  I would take your statements out of context
If I was you  I'd go low and come at your pops next
If I was you  I'd probably blame you for Cadalack Ron's death
I mean  getting high  getting high 

{Caustic gets mad and threatens Rone}

Listen to me Caustic  Listen to me Caustic 
Getting high in front of a recovery addict  why would he need that 
I can't believe that
So if I was you  I would probably blame you for his relapse

But I'm not you

I'm not you
I just know my friend would like to hear his name dropped
And I miss him
You miss him too 
Well I'ma put you in the same spot
Rest in peace  that's one

Round 2
CAUSTIC
Ooooh  he's gonna get personal with me  Oh gee golly wiz I can't wait
Why don't you go drink some fucking bleach since you think being white's that great
You used to be my right hand man  now you don't deserve my handshake
Game Of Thrones shit  still the King Slayer even though my right hand fake

I said I wish a motherfucker would  I be chopping 'em down
Blocks will come out  I be making Mr  Booblaka Chilaka Boo sounds
When it comes to rapping bitch I've been snapping longer than locker room towels
I'll have you stretched on a table with the doctors around
Just to tell you you ass out like a hospital gown

Oh   so I was walking around thinking like   Dude
What would make Adam just madder than hell 
What would take all the wind outta his sails  
Then he said   Well we should mention our girls names  
Well  don't you date that bitch Allison Dale 
Yeah  Why don't you pass the message to that slut and tell her I can excel in every way that Adam has failed
If you look at her pictures  her eyes are sad you can tell
She's so used to having two hands grabbing her tail
And get her asshole impaled by more African males than a crack addict in jail

And that's hard   

You know  that's a hard thing to live up to
But he makes up for it with a strong back rub and a solid  I love you  
He be kissing that bitch on the mouth like it's the love of his life
But deep down he knows he just ain't fucking her right
She's got the Black Snake Moan she likes a little mud in her pipes

I don't even know why she fucks this guy
He's all types of bitch  he's got red lips and rosy cheeks
Who the fuck you supposed to be  Tyler Swift 
You fucking giant vagina lip

I don't get what part you're not understanding
I don't know any other man in the world that could've called to have a mirror match with a tranny
I mean this is the difference between us
Y'all looking at a glimpse of a genius
But with all these pussy ass feminine little physical features
We all agree  there's No Shame if you decide to get rid of your penis

Well hold on  I got a question
How come every time somebody mentions a time Rone got molested
His face immediately looks like he just got a Botox injection 
Now  it's my chance to get him so  I better get him

I mean  fans love to tell you what you can and can't talk about but you know me  I never listen
They said  It's an automatic loss if you talk about Sandusky or any of his alleged victims  
Well as far as I'm concerned if you getting defensive about getting molested then you probably got fucking molested with 'em

Now I know talking about Sandusky is played but y'all know I got a little something to say
To be honest Adam  I've uh   studied your case
And I'm not saying that being molested makes somebody gay
But   you were on the track team
At any point did you consider just   running away 
Is that not something you would try 
I mean all those years of learning how to take a baton from behind
It's like you learned nothing from the guy

I mean maybe that's why your little album Committed was trash
You haven't dealt with all that shit from your past
Maybe all those Sandusky dicks in your ass changed your pitch when you rap
All those sexual assaults and you never did nothing back 
You got raped by your running coach no wonder you sound like such a bitch on your tracks

See I like saying shit like that just to watch him get rattled
But if you wanna see some really weird shit  why don't you check out his Complement Battle
Now  the second I turned it on I knew there was something fucking strange going down out here
But it did answer a long time question
Who's dick do you gotta suck to get a title shot around here 

And then you think and it's just you know  it's just Adam and Patrick
They're always coming up with the wackiest antics
You know  running around Canada  acting like faggots

But that's the part that makes me think somebody really raped you
Maybe you overplayed the gay thing to cover up how uncomfortable it actually makes you
So while you were out there pretending to be a couple gay dudes
How about the fact that for all that gay shit you did  Pat never actually paid you

Awww  this shit just got incredibly real

Aye  he done sucked a dude's dick and didn't even keep up his end of the deal
Adam calling every day and Pat's like   Don't worry Adam you getting it still  
And then you took him out to dinner in L A  and you got fucking left with the bill

That's amazing  my dude Pat  screwed you for two wacks
And you didn't do shit bitch  what part of Philly did they do that 
I mean and I don't blame him  look at Pat  he'd fucking whoop his ass

He wasn't trying to scuffle but he played it like it was an accident but you actually kind of got hustled
I bet you was having Sandusky flashbacks yelling at Pat like   Why did I trust you   
It sucks Adam you just can't help but get fucked by the guys you look up to

I said you either real or you ain't dawg  there ain't no in between
We ain't cut from the same cloth  I'm tailor made for the game or so it would seem
Cause when it comes to rhyming I'm on top if you know what I mean
You a cup of noodle  I'll peel your lid back just to blow off some steam

Infrared beams look like techno lasers
Dealership maintenance you just met your maker
So now's a good time to go ahead and accept yo' savior
Before I make the Devil your fucking next door neighbor
I said that's a sign you're a bitch  I ain't here to impress no haters
I said the deuce deuce is a good buy bye  I protect my paper
In a fair one  you won't fare well  I don't respect yo' gangsta
Plus I got a piece so long it'll catch you later

Bitch

Round 2
RONE
Man  that fucking gangsta shit is the weirdest shit I've heard about you
I talked to the rest of the white battle rappers and to be honest
The fellas are getting worried about you

Bro  it's like you can't decide if you're Jamal or Geppetto
An Italian who acts black  Where you from  The Spaghetto 

Talking about this fake drug dealer shit
Selling  copping  never stopping
Bragging 'bout who he sold to  Benny  Robby  Jenny  Johnny
He even made a deal in a Denny's lobby with Hammurabi
Bro  you know who else sold weed before  Fucking everybody 

Bro  my little sister  sold packs of loud shit
You don't hear her bragging 'bout it
My grandma's stylist was packing ounces
Shit  so was my dad's accountant

If you do all this secret illegal shit then why would you tell us 
He's like   Gangsters move in silence
And did I mention I sell drugs  

Well  I     whatever drugs you got
I'm talking crack  pills  heroin
Even if it's legal drugs  I'm talking Advil  Claritin
I'll throw your bitch off the roof like I'm Dan Bilzerian
I'll throw your shoes on the phone line while your man's still wearing 'em

You wife her  I'll snipe her like click click boom  La Di Da Di
She on the patch then I'm Slick Rick smooth
I'll send a photo of the bands then send a dick pick through
That's the chicken and the beef like a McPick 2

But I got a top five reasons you should not rap

Number 1  you are a cable guy for Comcast
You know what  Fuck the list  we can stop flat
Reasons one through five  they are all that

Fucking cable guys deserve a special section of Hell
Where the Devil tortures them sometime between 7 00 and 12 00
Fucking Ferry the Cable Guy  our second battle isn't stressing me
But I feel like Matthew Broderick cause the Cable Guy is obsessed with me

So this for every time you said 5 00 and showed up after 6 00
This is for every strangers toilet that you clogged with a massive shit
This is for every shitty operator y'all have ever had talk to me
Every one of them in India who claims their down the block from me

Fucking cable companies are an inherently un American symbol
Comcast runs a Monopoly and you just play the thimble

So I want remunerations for dealing with your faggot shit
So after I beat you  you're hooking me up with all of the sports packages
You know what  Fuck all the sports packages
I don't want sports packages let me be more accurate
I want the porn packages
Fucking Skinamax  Gimmie that
Bunny Ranch  I fucks with that

He's already asked but here's something you should know about me now
If I can't have battle rap I will burn it to the ground
I mean  Dizaster's been ducking me like I'm not in that class
Dizaster's been ducking me like some kind of Math class
I heard Tay Roc run his mouth  how is he a threat 
Bro  I would take care of Roc rock like a Chia Pet
Bro  I would take care of Roc like a PG vet
Bro  I would take care of Roc like a vet PG
I whip Roc rock like Nash when he's MVP
I would get rid of rock like an NBD
I'll 30 Rock Roc like the studios at NBC

And y'all might think I'm losing focus  but maybe you should know this
Before the battle I Instagram'd evidence that he doesn't write his own shit
So log onto @adamferrone to read every word now
Or just wait cause we'll get into it in that third round

Round 3
CAUSTIC
Yo  you mentioned my homie Ron   I swear to God I'm a writer
Bitch I could check this dick and feel nothing  I'm like Bonnie Godiva

They said   Caustic  did you see Day 1  'Cane was snapping  
I was like   Yeah  yes  But all his good lines were about me so I guess he still needs Caustic bars to get a major reaction  
I said  oh you didn't buy nothing right  'Cane 
What the fuck were you paying for when you made the transaction 
You know what  You can just walk around with this L but I guess Stranger Things have happened

I said my dude came
It was three years I was hoping that you'd change
But you're still the same bum begging for bars with loose change
I said you still got your mouth wrapped around another dude's name
You're like a shamed Olympian blaming the steroids for the poor decisions that you made

I said  Al can fucking blow me
At this point Al owes me some alimony
Acting like I snitched on somebody  no I just alerted my actual homie
About some fucking stranger who didn't pay me the fucking full amount that he owes me

But I'm no angel though
We've all gotten a couple bars along the way  you know 
But shit if we wanna talk about the ratio
I don't need a bunch of Facebook conversations posted to tell you what I gave to Rone

Oh   did you forgot 
When we were out there in England 
Don't Flop for the weekend
You couldn't finish your rounds cause you was too busy drinking
I gave you a whole round for Youthoracle right in front of you without even blinking
You're like   Hey  thanks Caustic I'm sorry I choked  But you don't write how I be normally speaking
But hey it'd be cool if we could keep this our little secret  

Awww  you little fucking faggot dude
Aye  you mad at me 
What about a week before your battle with T
And didn't have much help to give you but I did give you a little something didn't I you manatee

 Rone 

Never

 Caustic 

Never 
I mean imagine me
Bunch of people get credit for my writtens
But I can tell you like this  I've taken a lot less than I've given
So whoever's feeding you your information is telling you some fucking fiction
And besides  Erik Foreman helped you write this whole fucking battle so what's the fucking difference  

No 

See  if you look at his name it'll prove that he's a hypocrite in the long run
Cause he likes to sit around and call people frauds even though you are R one
I said I know who I am  these battlers should have a natural fear
But this is your second title match
I've had bars in title matches for the last three and half years
And if you're confused  you think that shit is weird
And you don't think that shit is actually true
Then why aren't you taking a second and ask half of the fucking battlers in this room

But it's Rone 

It's Rone who they've given me
He composes it like a symphony
He's simply  says simple things a bunch of filler schemes and similes
But he hides it behind this whiny high pitched delivery
So you can't tell he's the least quotable rapper in King Of The Dot history

I mean every since you became a little mini celebrity
You think you got all the answers like that guinea from Jeopardy
I'm sick of this fucking rich dickhead kid disrespecting me
The only privileged I ever had in my life was a fifth of Hennessy
And after I finish that I'm gonna find your little sister Stephanie
And dig her the fuck out like a hysterectomy
See him and Erik Foreman have been on the internet instant messaging
Desperately trying to discredit me
To make me lose I swear to God they'll do anything

But  I've got enemies
Got a lot of enemies but both you faggots 'bout to get the same vasectomy

But since you're a man of education let's look at it scientifically
You lost momentum while I gave it a simple transfer of energy
Cause if you break it down to the chemistry
Your volume to the masses doesn't have any density
Cause even in the most basic of matters
You just can't trust Adam atom cause they make up everything

You're a liar bro  You're a liar

I'm a liar  I'm a liar 
That's your observation 
The best you got is a 2012 Photoshop conversation 
Suck a fucking dick 
That shit is fucking finished
You're supposed to be a fucking champion  now you out here coming with gimmicks

Dude that shit is fucking actually true
If you were a real fucking champion you would've showed up to the event and interacted with fans like champions do
Your trend ended before you started you're the Ed Hardy of battling dude

Dude  I was gonna retire after I won this shit

That's some shit I thought I never would say
I was just gonna take the chain and left y'all for dead
Then I thought about it  is that really how this legend will end 
Then I said   Fuck it 
I'd rather stay and break Pat's record instead 

So this is not a regular battle round
You know  a verse on his weaknesses
So fuck a crowd  fuck a crown  these are personal grievances

So let's not mince words
You missed your first battle with Big T cause you were hung over from some bad coke
On Friday you're doing great  the next day you can't go
Once the fans had their money paid and that's why you're fucking fake
Cause you were in Chicago at the venue but couldn't go because a tummy ache 
Bro  what the F is that 
How is he your expecting champ when he might miss any heavy scratch from a bout of the menstrual cramps
Fuck losing any respect  mine for dude didn't exist
Cause I did the same drugs and was fine  your immune system's a bitch

But the very worst thing from the scene from that night
Worse than Mr  Free Drugs being a fiend for that white
Is your slogan   Free Drugs  I was believing the hype
And then I watched you pay for those shitty drugs at a fucking premium price
I mean  what happened to the slogan dawg  I really believed that
When I say  Grandmom's favorite grandson  ask my grandmom I really mean that

But yo  there's something bigger about your fame that has driven me insane
How you made your whole name off of ghostwriting for Arcane
But behind the scenes us battlers know you in a different way
You are the most notorious recipient of shared bars in the game

Oh y'all want names 
Y'all want names 
Fresco never gave you bars 
Fredo never gave you bars 
Frank Stacks never gave you bars 
D Lor never gave you bars 
Fucking Reverse Live never gave you bars 
Fucking Real Deal never gave you bars 
Bro  fucking Marvwon never gave you bars 
Madness never gave you bars 
Bro  and that's the ones I know  imagine ones I don't

Imagine all his secrets if that's the stuff he shows
I mean the first time he called me for bars we weren't even bros then
It was against fucking Roosevelt and that was back in '010

It's really just incredible what he does behind the scenes

{KOTD crowd member starts losing his fucking mind  Apparently shouting out at no one like he's on PCP or some shit}

I watched five battlers give him bars for Mr  13
Vers' Arsonal  Chedda Cheese  every battle it's obscene
Last year vers' Big T it was full four bar schemes
And you still skipped the battle after I directly gave you bars
So stop lying you are not genius that you claim you are

Battles on 24 hours notice really aren't that exciting for him
When you realize he probably has like 24 writing for him
I mean  fucking getting bars  burning bridges  that just shows he's a selfish guy
His slogan  Free Drugs  that explains his health's decline
But after all his snitching it was on himself this time
Cause Mr  Free Drugs has always needed someone else's lines

And the way you vilified Arcane when you are ten times the cheater
That's like getting ethic lessons from fucking Carlos Mencia
Go and get your ghostwriters I guarantee they're not enough
Oh you write your own shit  Yeah so does Melania Trump

I said you really can't compare duke
I say shit they're scared to
You dig dirt  find someone that's written for me  I fucking dare you 

Bro  this is for all that bad karma you built up
All that cattiness displayed
Because all of that bad karma that comes back to you TODAY

So I hope you get STD's to what you said to Q Shinobi
Based on what you said to K  I hope you lose one of your closest homies
For what you said to Caddy I wish you dope scared veins
And your mom deserves to die for what you said about Arcane
Based on Soul  I hope your girl moves away  far from you
From Jeff  I hope she cheats  just to make it hard from you
From Ex I I hope you know the guy
And just to make it horrible
I hope it's one of your best friends from what you said to Arsonal
I hope they run a train on her from what you said to Cortez
I hope she gets a restraining order from what you said to Megadeath
Then I hope you get back together and the two of you have babies then I hope that fucking kid's retarded from what you said to Matt Daley

Bro  you are a rat and a snake

That's just how I see him
This is bigger than rap beefing  both coasts or regions
So I'm not lobbying for a win and I don't care if you believe it
But any league where he's the champ isn't one I want to be in

Michael Pointer
Saint Mic 
You know they are gonna pin this Saint vs Saint  to Market the Fight 
And me  Well I brought a lotta Bars  that way this Mark gets the  fight  in me 
If yall had any reservations  this where I change yalls mind 
I m gonna say some stuff you rock with  but a lot of it you ain t gon like
but first off  KC I feel slighted  some of yall thought he was coming to my city  my stage
to beat my breaks on Sight 
The code word  informant  the question…
Why re  wire  you acting like I don t know the Tape on Mic 
Let s get it  
The critics label you exquisite your lyrics they said I can t match it 
So for weeks I stacked bars in my head I jam packed it 
To help put on a show
cuz straight up bro  you always fed the fans classics 
So I pushed my pen over and over
and over… like I forgot the digits on a debit transaction 
What up Mic  Yeah we ain t the same type  I ain t that killer squeezing… 
But we gon  put this loss on cam… like the end of von millers season 
I don t battle rap for money  the bread don t fulfill a need 
But I do JONES for PAPER in a sense 
cuz I got QLEEN delivery and be CHILLA scheming 
Go ahead    Tell them I paid to get you here  Reveal the secret 
It s cool…  I just needed something cheap to take flight on 
Now it s plain to see your Spirit Leaving  

*That was Fiyah*   Godzilla Breathing   
I don t care if you came with a few new choppers 
Rocket launcher bigger than 2 Chewbacca s 
You move to awkward  everything my pen touch breaks like voodoo doctors 
plus I m covered in the blood without the soowoo partners 
These punch lines heavy  they can suit you proper 
You ain t gotta be smoking 2 feel  2 phillies  these oowap ya 
Losing to me  that s an uncool  uncle  death  like scar when he through Mufasa 
I m putting you close to the flame like you knew waka 
You in my town now  they like who you patna  
KC  Tell Saint the only Mic we rock with is Moustakas   Royals 3rd baseman  
Loose Screw Pasta  It s a reach  but I m crazy off the noodle – I m good aak 

I know how to handle my leverage  I could pull up and make the hood pop 
Bar 4 Bar I m nice too  off that strength alone  a 30 I could drop 
But why would I when I also got performance for days  like Woodstock 
Bro I wish you would stop…  cuz let him tell it over 
He s stacking bodies on top of bodies    Like he can smell the odor 
Oh you can sir  cancer   Well what gets under my skin like melanoma 
Is the fact you ve only beat a couple backup PGs… Don t nobody brag about crossing up Delladova  
The realest Soldier… I m not a Fan of ya movement 
But I could give you a lot of pointers consider this a family Reunion 
How  Cuz in my rds you won t hear an Eff you Bar

Or get ya face bucked  I m sprayin  
Wait… what… I m playing 
But I will snatch mic up on the stage  I Kanye him 
Get to thinking man I don t promote violence  let God save him 
Turn around and start to coach lil saint
I m Sean Payton  
Look I aint come to get personal with you

Scratch that  If ya man jump in  I ll put your dog in a bag  that s a purse with a Shih Tzu 

Don t go bezerk church  I didn t curse I said purse with a  Shih Tzu 
Mic this Rd gon  feel longer than a church service I sit through 

But this first isn t even the worst I promise that 3rd gonna get you 
So fall in line  And I ma tell  him GOD IS GOOD  All the TIME  

SAINT MIC
Y all probably going to say I m going to Hell after this 

But if yall know anything about Saint Mic biblically then you know at the least lyrically it s kind of my job to beat the  Hell  out of him 

I mean you on  Fire  right now baby 

Even locally has the potential to sell out events  so to sell out he vents 

Cause whether the money fast or it s moving slow even a tortoise know he gotta  Shell  out the rent so  

Why yall think I m out here battling this old  Grinch that stole Christianity in the face looking as bitch   you re a mean one 

Charging all these people to come out here and watch you pre judge they brethren all while you praise the Heavens  but what the Hell happened to you upper lip 

I know we aint discussing dogs in heat but aint  thiiiiis bout a fucking bitch  

Only member of Beard Gang w no mustache cause every time he tried to grow one the hair just sliiiiid of yo fuckin shit 

It s Saint Mic vs the youngest Ned Flanders Oh  howdaly doodaly  Wow you re so new to me  Honestly I don t know what to say to you 

Old Bearenstein Bear cliff lip having ass look like your whole life consisted of playing flute   whistle 

And your ancestors got me so conditioned to believe Jesus is White when I heard you bring Jesus to fights I aint know whether to come here and beat your ass to death or pray with you 

But since the goal of Christianity is to be Christ like I figured like Christ either was is cool  that s right guys he forgave you too  and you gone have to do a whole lot more than punch  scheme  and scream in Jesus name to make this debatable 

What if I told you God hated you 

And made you pay me to come here and Kill you as a way of proof  could you play it cool 

You know being denied entrance through the pearly gates of truth  after making all these people believe he favors you  And ironically the little angry black guy is the one who had a place for you 

You know if somebody asked me that I couldn t answer scrap just know this ass whipping gone feel the same…  I m pretty much describing the rest of your day for you 

You know how I know you re a gimmick 

Because you use religion as a common ground turn around  judge me on how I vent my evils 

You know how I know you re a gimmick 

Cause as a Christian you know damn well this aint the place where we supposed to portray we re equals 

You know how I know you re a gimmick 

Fuck that I don t even need to just know I call my self Saint Mic because I m that good with one  that s just me fool 

Plus something like  Gods Wrath  is what he uses for those that He brew  Hebrew   I am lethal 

I am Only here to trim the fat that s what I must slim  Muslim  when I see food 

So while these Christians deny the Jew they is  Judaist  I promise after tonight he will not see  Nazi  his people 

Oh Jew  you  mad  Nah Jew Gassed  and guess who brought that Chamber to sleep you 

And tell your people  I suggest they move in silence  cause whoever boo this  Buddhist  can get the piece  peace  too 

Or need I remind you  You not my brother  or kin  Orkin  Man  see your religion work in sects  Work Insects  and we Protest Ants  Protestants  need I define you 

Cool cause I got more men  Mormon  to prove Karma s a bitch and in the end  Indian  Karma is right behind you  U   Oh what  I know it sounds like a reach  but it is true because if you re indian then Karma is right you d be Hindu 

What we doubt the bars  Only reason I was Tsu  surfing  the heavens in that last line was to prove it don t take a trophy rapper to reach out to God  Aaaaaah 

Yall must think to sock a God MC is not in me  Until the god in me and this boxer speed get him rocked to sleep when I see niggas  I get it  shaking  you fucking with the greatest so if he don t show where the Cash is  Cassius  in  Clay  is where I leave  Ali  niggas  End this Christian with the Ba  Ba  Like his first name Ali nigga 

I m a beast nigga  I eat niggas  I m a cannibal in sync with Animal instincts  I  Complex bars  to  break niggas  So you dealing with a Cannibal in sync with animal instincts and I m a Precinct   Lights Out  

Cause when IBattle I Bangz with the Can like  Get em a fucking Sod… Blaow  This dirty pop have em looking like he dancing with NSync I m nice 

God is Good…  Crowd  All the Time  So see what makes you think we need to have you here to remind us of what the Savior could  How about you remind everybody here that you re a part of the biggest Mob in the world and that Bible got more bodies on it than any dirty pistol in any one of my niggas neighborhoods 

You know what the crazy shit is  Last time I battled a white boy worth mentioning he practiced Atheism  I told him he was the same as Christians 

Another man corrupted by a butt fucking lame conviction  plagued with Pagan and plagiarism used to control and help him cope with the way he living  Say it isn t  Next round not only am I going to state specifics I m a make it vivid  go ahead with ya little criticism about my career and ya Saint flips nigga 

Round 2
A  WARD
Can I switch it up a little this rd   Yall cool with that  Good  Cuz in my preparation for Mic
Often times I was smitten with Laughter 
With that said its bad credit  this I can t do alone…
So what I m fixing to ask ya 
Is I need yall s help with this schooling…
So consider this  me submitting my FAFSA

 No we re not through  – I came with a Game plan

Wouldn t ride with a Tech  if you were a Strange Fan  

At S Crib E don t spray Cans 
I doubt fire  you re not a Made  maid Man 
In the Trap  you never handled a kilo or weighed Tan 
Heck  if your Nana had chemo you wouldn t shave grams    LOOK BRO  – YFN  
And none of those Cities are popping up on an episode of Ganglands  
Lol  So you were born gutter  You a 4 tucker 
You probably in a Rap Group called Saint Mic and the Corn Hustlers  
Go head  act like I wasn t on your Radar friend 
Maybe I got NEBRASKA Backwards and that s where the AKS n AR BEN 
You want to play hard then 
Cool Champ  I m what your Title Spot Fears  
I roll with JC and Cannon  but ain t nobody from writers bloque near 
you rep abbo  Congrats bro  your flight has stopped here 
you all gas  Pork n Beans   should ve ducked – Oregon s team
Dinner Served – Fork and Screen   after this Jordan Meme   Mic ll Drop Tiers  
And me   Well my stock is risen  I m thankful everyday that I got the vision  and it s not religion 
My Job description is Love God  Love People and Bar your life away  and when it comes to those 3 things… all I do is deliver like an Obstetrician 
Never stop the Mission – I impart halos  already turned 2 dudes from the Lou into arc angels 
What Cuz I m Christian I can be Nice  but the Bars ain t bro  Yeah Right  When I rap  Jawz drop Everywhere  I turn the place into Sharknado 
On this Stage You light  and I m stealing the spot 
I was rooting for you verse Young X  I thought you were the one giving the shot 
It flipped against Anubis  I wanted him to start Digging the Plot  
Ironic I ve been 2 types of Fan  and now I m here sealing  ceiling  the Box

But here you are trying to Rock it  Rocket  again…  Who brought you back Michael  Beasley  
Believe me  Son s weak  – All of these Empty threats are Tongue Cheek
His slogan   Give him 2 pieces of bread and call him lunch meat  
Please do  I serve a God who took few pieces of bread and let a bunch eat  

*Slogan*

SAINT MIC
That was pretty nice kid  But let me show you how to damage the nicest  Through channeling vices 

Most celebrated bible thumpers was later exposed as some sluts  like you about to be  Out here trying to get a good hold of some nuts and he aint clamping them vice grips 

Don t look at me King  Cause look too long and get his  Royalty Check  I m strapped with the tools and no  mechanical license  

You know I remember back when I first witnessed that one round extended match between you and some other senseless act  And you mentioned that you got into rap to talk to nonbelievers and bridge the gap  

And in the very instance you spit that rap I genuinely commended that  but something didn t match so I listened back something missing scrap… I mean outside the fact he s Christian  raps  At home and on sight  site  shout out ya Journalist for that  He believes in scripture  but puts his ten percentage in it as  Faith in God but not in man  who inspired by God wrote the book from where he gets it at so… Out side of a couple Christ flips and the aforementioned facts…  what s so Christ Like about what this nigga yaps 

Is it the Self Proclaimed righteousness via passive  aggressive  ambiguous attacks  Or the fact he has yet to mention any Devine message given  or expressed suggestion on how we should be giving back  See now I gotta ask where your intentions at 

And how do you plan or intend to bridge the gap between this and that  When it s pretty specific that in this extent of rap the jist is that you go tit for tat  Wits get matched by way of some pretty judgmental and offensive raps to win the match  lift his stats  get some scratch  And by doing so  the losing opponents opportunities are actually slimmed in fact  so I m saying where exactly is God s gift in that  I m not implying I m confident that it s nonexistent  but if so how do you plan to implement it skrap 

I don t think you got the answers Sway  So allow an Emcee with no gimmick to kick the facts  All my real niggas know we vent the violence to prevent the violence and that right there is God s gift to rap  So don t come up here  lying in who s name you preaching ya false teachings like you came here to heal the streets with that  We are positive and negative by God s design  and even He know where I m from just venting  rather than doing the shit is about as positive as niggas gonna be with rap  so bitch keep ya act 

It s like yall gas his bars cause he told you he works on behalf of the staff of God  And yall just believed it  Well he doesn t have to cuss in his bars  Not afraid to say he fears God  he s not a fraud just flawless  a marketing genius  How  If I didn t know no better I d think you think he getting phone calls with some fucking exclusive offers from Jesus   It aint Sunday  If yall need to know more of the bible nigga  yall should just read it 

That mutha fucka aint stashed in the Vatican or with Smack and them all vaulted and secret  He aint Cortez  Just another Christian with an agenda hidden for attention to his name through a mission that for Centuries already been force fed 

See what A Wards using is better known as Consumer relation  A little marketing tactic  publicly owned  were he ll say yall his brothers and sisters but really view you as consumer related  So he sat back  studied  and consumed the relation  same way Christian Pilgrims that was cruising them Slave Ships    that moved to the States did  Seeking to start a new civilization  they claimed they d teach a new  civil  way to elude and portray that they cool with its Natives  And look who doing the same shit  Using his faith as a tool of invasion  borrowing another groups innovations  in hopes the consumer relates so he can consume what they making 

But like most I see the Greed in you  Yea you been impatient  So allow this surgery I give you be inpatient  And all you fake teachers  preachers  doctors  polices  all involved  if I gotta come back and slaughter hogs I m a get this whole strip baking  bacon   Mack a mockery of mine I ll come back and kidnap your first born daughter dog for having my identity a lil mistaken  miss taken  bitch  Aint no way he can say he killing me  for the rest of his life he ll view this battle as a Slim Shady inury  and embrace  Em  brace  the shit 

Round 3
A  WARD
I figure since we here  let s have some dialogue 
Right now  I want to talk with Saint  later we ll get the Mic involved…
You see that Word Saint  holds a dear meaning to me  because I walk in light 
I too am considered a Saint  but we don t walk alike 
The Greek word is Hagios  HA GE OSE   Morally blameless  physically pure  sacred 
But first let s bring that to context before we got into more layers 
There is none without Sin  That s why Christ came and in light  Scripture
Depicts him as Jesus of Nazareth  a Jew   I m not sure who that dude is in the White pictures 
But Ride with me      His death and resurrection became the atonement for our lives 
Therefore through Grace by Faith  we have hope that is in God 
So as I servant we are covered  we ve been washed from the stains right 
So we re called Christians And that is the definition of a Saint  Mic   
Now correct me if I ain t right  I feel you telling God  this ain t my cup a tea 
When he lookin back like it could ve been this…  Saint Mic up a T…
Now I won t sit up here and say you re lost   Cuz I don t know you from Adam 
But it does seem we re cut from different fabric  so I should probably show you the patterns 
Ever FELT you were Caught in  COTTON  a mess let s say the Rents due 
It s a tough FLEECE  lease  you and roommate don t MESH and you re spent too 
You sat an  SATIN  thought about it  cuz you owe a band and Plug is getting a cut 
So  SEW  what he need ll  NEEDLE  put you in the read  THREAD   unless you get to stitchin him up 
Yall wasn t listenin up 
…  Cuz some of yall looking at me like son that s whack 
But I said we cut from different Fabrics so you gon think its fire when I …  run that back 

*Runs back with emphasis on scheme*

Let s get to stitching him up 
I said we d get around to Mic Right  
Well I m old school like Yak Bak s and a Lite Brite 
If I wanted I could put you in this knapsack Night Night  
So thank God I m a changed Man 
Cuz Grace is that Gap between Michael and this Stray Hand 
I don t play fam…
It s not fair to rappers 
Another REASON  I see you base  CUBASE  your LOGIC off being a PRO with TOOLS
but I can tell you re soft where  Software  it matters 
Who engineered you  If something this Foul Can reach the Top – think Julio Stretching 
It s nothing to Hit him High – that s Coolio Message 
When a Wolf in ya face    it ain t Rubio Pressin  
This for every time a Mic issue  messed up anybody s Studio Session 
Move to the side  cuz we on Next 
They overhyped you like you Go Rilla cuz you Beat on Chess 
I m not convinced  Yall can hashtag Rise of the Saint  
But right  now you lookin 5ft 5 in the Paint  – Lord stop him  Ford Shopping Go Find an Escape 
Let s get rid of him  Death Certificate  just sign and then date 
A different breed of Killer  Use kindness and faith 
This battle bro  Plaxico  your shots were a Giant Mistake 
Stop the Gun Talkin  you Son s watching…  He gon  mime what you say 
Tell your 4th Grader you love him  that s how a real man looks a 9 in the face 
*Slogan*

SAINT MIC
Jesus Christ  ya boy just doesn t get it  Broke em down  two rounds  he still trying to punch his lil heart out   Got the nerve to stand here all poised in his position   We all seek gain in the name  but to convince his niche he ll tell you it s just poison that I m spittin   And maybe you right  Through all the damage I ve provided  it does seem like I m glamourizing violence but this aint me glamourizing this me getting the poison out my system 

God s gift to man was free will  You know  choices and decisions  So what s worse  Me up here hypothetically enforcing my existence or you forcing his conviction  I mean all the theatrics  running back to ya man dapping  fake laughing for consensus yet the hardest thing to do for you Christians  is listening 

Initially  I comprehended ya mission was to fill us with hope  Show us how to follow the will of the G O A T   put down the pills and the dope  not criticize and try to kill us with quotes  or did you forget God will judge us both   Look how many people came here for ya show  and judging by ya battle with FMag before you speak God s will  you will judge an ear studded nose…  Well that s not Christian like…

But it is his type  Pathetic  The source of your hunger…synthetic  And even my stomach will tell you the real source for hunger is pain  You in this shit for your benefit not his ya bitch and the proof is all in this pigeon s name  You want an Award 

Well you gone have to get it like Tyson nigga let s get loose  I mean you do have some  nasty stuff  in them  sucky rounds  to be  white  shit …In other words Anubis was clit  and you tit juice  and I don t think you want me to squeeze to get proof 

Fuck a Flanders  You softer than some girl butt  Cant handle the bars get curled up  from these  ten speeds  leave em  rotten  for the  cabbage  turn Kimzy into Kimchee 

Greed  sloth  pride  wrath  gluttony  lust  envy  there s seven deadly sins and at the least bitch I am three  Till I Die im a keep it  100  I m man of the  Century  

Look at his face  He gone try to say he isn t bothered  But he is  Starting to realize the difference between his creator and his father  You get to ask God  What   I gotta ask him  Why   We say two different prayers  we are two different problems 

This  Man  up to  Bat  and  you niggas  Gotham   I do what I want here  who finna stop him  You  Nigga stop it 

Ah shit  I m bout to make it hard for the world to defy me why  because 95 percent of you battle rap niggas a bunch of  bitches slapping bitches  around… Why are you trying to be the next Heidi Fliess  female Pimp   I don t know  But pussy nigga if I find out you out here pitching Christian  flipping bitches  or slicing pies  I will make sure every D Boy in ya crew will get murdered quick to put the  tools to your servers  I m the IT Guy 

Yea I m the IT factor  I kill a clown  Killer Clown   Pump  to a  Writer  mouth   Horror Fiction  aint ya job homie  You know the movie  It  factored in a Killer clown  and since he was in fear in the end I switched gears and came with  eight arms  on me  Saint Mic  Only angel that can blaze you niggas yea I m strapped with the Saviors Sinner the wrath of God on me 

KC  Cuz ya family  Understandably   But since yall locked in  A Ward  perhaps I should free you of some of the Insanity  I mean  Come to these pussies  Regardless of what he believes you can believe we dumpin  I m a MidWest Dickhead Cunt how could you not  see me coming  

I don t care if we moving it s Christmas  we smoking  Leftovers  nigga you can t rap better than me in nothing 

You softer than ya baby pictures  Yall know Greek Mythology  Who gives a fuck  One to his  Cap  make em  invisible  Im a make it  hard to see the God  like he Hades nigga  My left  Wyclef have a wack spiritual rapper running for Haiti nigga  We thrive when it s beef you ll die in the streets I ride with a piece  peace  you couldn t see  C  my  Class  in a Mercedes nigga 

**Missing Bars**

I will kill any that fight foul with me  wild as me  How is he  You deliver it quite cowardly I ll hit you in yo chest so hard it change the logo from die daily to die hourly 

Heavenly Father  Prayer  I have not come to challenge you but more so the institutions that you bounded to  I was told to not  shoot  the  messenger  so I bring no disrespect to the Father  I just want him to  shoot  this  message  to SAGA    click  BLAKA 

Let me talk to y'all before I get in my groove 
Last time I was around  I beat Realiztic in four days 
so tell me what do I got left here to prove 
I know he asked for a name but  I asked for one too 
so why the fuck did I get left here with you 

They say a closed mouth don't get fed but
Y'all gave me P Nut peanut and now it's like an elephant's in the room

But I know  you like to freestyle right 
So what you gon' say  I'm the elephant 
Well go ahead then  come up here and front
Just know that one wrong move  I'll be an elephant to you
That just mean I'm putting Nut in the trunk

You think you King Of The Dot  I post up  waiting for him to TalkBack
He ain't think I was crazy til I'm in Nut house nuthouse with my arms strapped
Everything you say  dick and ass  we both had DNA but I'm not that
You can try dumping me but I'm not Math

Who you kidding  My niggas use to gorillas
This half white boy die where the croc's at

You not rap  your two fans in L A  will kill you in secs to bring 'Pac back
The Glock clap  they couldn't protect Nut with a jock strap
You got that  I can tell from your frail ass wrists you do not scrap
So get the 10 if you want
I wouldn't miss the P Nut peanut if he leaned sideways with a top hat

Your girl  I know just where to plant her planter
That's why y'all bugging thinking he more talented
I'll draw on him and put his frame all over the wall for the peanut gallery

Boy you fucking with great  hide your filler it's a fucking disgrace
Don't just rap nigga  be that nigga
Give me something that's ugly  that's nasty to taste
Say some shit like   Bonnie would use your grill as a cum rag but you're used to having Nut in your face  
See that's half of the bait but y'all get slashed at a bank and still wouldn't cut to the Chase

You know what's up
Like if we had a shootout  you showing up 
Nigga even suited for war
First round he freezed next to the Cal' like Loaded Lux

So go 'head and call me a  bitch  nigga
But I'll put this bitch nigga in a cobra clutch
You think I won't crack a shell open and leave you leaking you sniffing that coca Nut coconut

Your blood  They'll be soaking up
And here's how the story goes
The 40  blew Nut through the wall  that's a glory hole

The last nigga I battled  I'm saying that cause you a Deadman too
But anyway  the last nigga I battled  QP  yeah he was on the Maury Show
But you gon' get the First 48 and no words  just text under the table like boring dates
I cool  hell
You'll get pennies for thoughts  I move wells

So who you trying to showboat for 
I mean we all caught wind that your crew sailed
You're too frail and I don't spare shook niggas so don't you dare look bitter
This ain't lunchtime  it's crunch time
And every bone in P Nut still look brittle

So don't stare too long or knife victim  I ice pick him
You'll leave here facing more holes than The Saurus's yearbook pictures

YTG

P NUT
Ayo Bonnie G

Who gon win  Prolly me
It's battle of the sexes  but say I got sloppy D it's Rocky 3
You bring a hot to the ring than Folgers  coffee beans  pop and squeeze
Hit your left and right wing  hockey team
Golly G I  give her the piece peace that's Gandhi steez
And leave dots on her muffin like poppy seeds

I'm possibly  the wrong one to bicker with
I don't know which angle to take  but even if it's hit or miss
I'll hit a miss with the same dish she made dinner with
Fuck your Twitter pics
I got two words for you  stripper tits
You're only sexy when the liquor hits and still can't please where Richard is

Survival of the fittest
Think we fam' until I flip the script
Dig a ditch and leave a sister behind like Cinderella when the slipper fits

I'm sick of this  but it's cool  cause we ain't close
So we ain't gotta bond Bon'  rub the buns Bon'
She ain't fat  she got Puffy jeans genes that's Sean John
You fuck rappers than brag about it  my respect for you is long gone
I'll burn Bon' with the Tom Tom  I'm Don Juan
Kill the pussy then sleep inside it like a Tonton

I lock on everything from men to you  you passed Math
John John was lesson two  I ain't really trying to focus on the men and you
But it's funny how them pounds gave a trend to you

Rep your crew  YTG  used to be Innuendo
Cause we in yo' window  and if you with it  in the end you win doe
But  when do you win though 
Funny how you switch crews but still let dudes in your window

So fuck the chain  your name alone has a rep for porn
So the question forms  who's next  Ness or Born 
Chef or Storm 
Ayo Debo  it's obvious you're less informed
The only shot she deserves the Depo form

I mean ain't you heard  Less is more you attention whore
You leave black balls dry  you're a peppercorn
You used to be good  now a days your progression poor

So back it Bonnie  if you rap  you prolly seen the back of Bonnie
That's why nobody's backing Bonnie
So laugh at Bonnie cause if two tits equal a title shot  I'm attacking Bonnie
I'll pack a Tommy and split the couple like Shaq and Shaunie

Rest in peace to Caddy
Shit  now a days I'm on the same path as Ronnie
That means I'll start with one hit than give her more
If my dawgs want a piece I tell them  sic the whore 
The second she hit the floor  I give her my knee  Hermione  like Gryffindor
That's Hermione her my knee  Gryffindor
I'll put her in the figure four
You may have battled some fucking men but you ain't seen this shit before

Time

Round 2
BONNIE GODIVA
They really flew me  back from NY to Cali  just to give you a shot
This is an actual Biggie
But whoever assist in this chapel get drawn on like this is Vatican City
You think you matching up with me 
Boy if I throw a jab to your kidney
One nip will leave you hanging like you're actual titties

The thought of you harming me  comedy
I'm not a P Nut fan
Your dogs sleeping on you holmes
It could be you and Snoop  that still wouldn't be a P Nut gang

Go run and hide  fuck who told you  you tough  your mother lied
But choose wrong and you'll lose blood like a cousin died

This fag wouldn't pop  he got the swag of a cop  I wonder why
Hmmm
Maybe you should stand next to Farrell  you been a Mark  that makes you The Other Guys

I should get you chucked off the roof
No  you might as well just run off and jump
You better Step Brother before I put Nut on a drum

But on another note  I give Nut the butter and watch the fucker choke
Calling animal cruelty how P's the  PETA  one spilling blood on his coat
PETA spill  it's aight

This outdated bastard is a Shady rapper
Like on the surface he look and ready
But inside he's really all forgiving  promotes wholesome living
And even says  no  to women

I mean you should see it
Soon as they give him a hole to dig in
He's like   You know what  Maybe we should call it a night  I don't want to make the wrong decision  
I mean P Nut  make up your mind are you a smuck or  Smucker  not 

Do P Nut freeze up when he see the jam 
Well either hand make you fly from the Hook like Peter Pan

I give Peter  pan
Split P down to vegetable soup  I'm Progressive I keep a can
But since you look like Uncle Fester I see the reason you need a hand

I'll let my whole team do her dirty  Lebron style when I let your moms have it
These bars right here  Monday morning at welfare  the lines ratchet
And you suck on beat  you might as well blow a candle and start waxing
Cause you live the life of a pussy so bitch make your bars match it

You swear you prone to violence but complain vers' Dose that you ain't known
That's childish
I know real niggas with pops that they don't acknowledge
Who grew up broke and jobless  got hope in college
Then still graduated  broke and jobless
And you mad about rap nigga 
If you was a real black nigga  you'd know your whole fucking life gon' be a broken promise

But y'all think P Nut special right 
So go 'head with them stories and get a laugh
About QP writing for me
Or Math looking up to as a better dad
But real talk  I made myself pop  with my father's approval
Now I'm at a door  matador  so when I hear that bull I ain't never mad
Cause I know deep down inside
You just mad that I get the career that you'll never have

YTG

P NUT
I said ahh

Battling Bonnie  I ain't got a bit of worry
Hit man for hire  get green over beef like chimichurri
Flip the birdy  Xcel  Dose and you
I'll make a name off the three and get a glimpse of Curry
I'm sick  if y'all think the chick can cure me  she chicken curry
She got her eyes on the chain  but her vision blurry
I'm vicious  nerdy  mean punches  the quickest flurry
That hit below the belt  like her tits at 30

Let's be real  this whole shit is gimmick worthy
I told people I'm battling Bonnie
They said   P why  Cause if she had a dick she'd be another rapper on PY  

See I know the facts  no holding back
You could be anything in life   man  who the fuck told you that 
I mean you should be an actress with a golden plaque
Cause you play a part whenever rappers grope your back

The list goes on but let's close the gap
You can't be a model engrossed in fat
Your body you Let It Go  that's a Frozen track
Frozen tracks  you can't make a move so you're phoning Smack
Cause battling is your only outlet  you're a cul de sac

I notice that you play the gender role like the shit's corrupt
But give it up  it's not cause you're a woman that we're quick to punk
I mean listen up  if you were really top ten  you'd be listed once
But the ship has sunk
I mean yeah  you got the power to script the punch
But we don't like Lisa Leslie and that bitch can dunk 

This chick's a stunt
You fish for funk I'll rock yo' shit backwards like I missed the bus
Let's be real  you don't bring shit to this league but tits and trunk
King Of The Dot  without Bonnie it ain't missing much
Our resumes got a different touch
I rely on bodies  YOU can't catch a body so you rely on yours to build it up
But the jig is up  jiggle butt
You want a shot at the chain  How 'bout you fucking win for once 
It's probably asking a little much  but stop looking for handouts
Try being a push up bra and use your pad to lift you up

I said  fuck Bonnie   I hate you from your face to your titty tat
Your punches ain't shit  they pity pats
So gimme that  you gon' face a Hollow  like they pity Pat
See I'm a Bad Boy  tell Diddy that
50 gats coming for G Unit like 50 raps
That semi clap  You'll get it near the bush  that's a Wrigley catch

What the fuck you gon' do  Diddly jack
Stand there and just receive the damage
You got two options  leave or vanish
I'm better than you so  I give me advantage
Who's winning  Me ho  mi hijo  I ain't speaking Spanish

Round 3
BONNIE GODIVA
You talking 'bout using my pad to life me up  right 
Well I can turn one of your lines better that you just said to show I'm dope with that
What you should've said is  I'll come through and give your whole street a round  that's a cul de sac

I seen your last battle in     boy
Now I'm off the Dose  let's cut the jokes
Divorced couple in bed  we ain't fucking close
Don't get it twisted like nuts and bolts
I'll give Nut the bolt but as far as nuts  I'm cutting both

I mean  I'm dealing with P Nut  right 
You've been coming out your shell lately
So I'm thinking it's time I up and roast

Why you look so salty P Nut 
Is it cause you a Finding Nemo fan
Or cause when you jerk off it squirt off and you don't even need both hands 
On top of that  we don't know if you got a baldy or a Cesar fam'
It's either like you got the worst barber or best chemo plan

How you trying to campaign for presidents if nobody knows your face 
You wanna know why you on the most underrated run ever 
Cause nobody knows your race
Like are you Haitian  Mexican  Middle Eastern  Half Caucasian 
Are you fucking  I don't know  Spanish  Portuguese  Pacific Islander  Are you Asian 
You know what  I think he's Indian cause now I'm having reservations

Like  I'm a heavyweight  sick with the skill
He featherweight  he just stick to the quill
I would say you best in the house nigga
But you was never a top pick in the field

I mean you have right  But that don't mean you can rap with niggas
And having action figures  only means you get no action  figures

Save your penmanship  derelict heritage  pace for emphasis
You could switch up your tone but you ain't the stereotype

AM feminine
Let's settle this
You were the first to get booked then brought light in the game  that's Sega Genesis
But I'm the second bitch to take you out the Family  Guy cause Mega Definite

I mean  wake up
I know  I know you hate AM  Ayem 
Every morning the hate hang over your head seeing as how you hate AM  Ayem 
But you picked the wrong night
And we gon' see if it dawn on you after I break AM  Ayem 
I'm 730 but the big hand on the  45  you'll get ate 8 00 AM  Ayem 

The Glock that I enter  like a doc with no temper
I never felt patience
 22 pinned to his head if he Hellraising
Then you know what I'ma do
Y'all know what I'ma do to P Nut 
 What  
Put him underground with a shell casing

But you know what  You ain't even flip that shit about elephants  that's sad
You a little irrelevant bitch
That's why they see P Nut dropping now
Cause you ain't use to all that elephant shit

YTG

P NUT
I ain't have to flip that elephant shit
And that cul de sac line I liked it better  see when it comes to this battle shit
We got different views  this shit is true
Your tits are what positioned you  but listen boo
I don't care if you show up butt naked to this battle  your gimmick's through
I mean yeah  sex sells but sometimes we wonder which are you 

I mean it's real talk  I came here to wig on Bonnie
Like that fucking wig on Bonnie

I said word on the street  people scared to battle Bon'
I guess I fell for that bait like the tackles strong
But this a mismatch the fashion wrong
I get it  she rapped against men so y'all clap along
Til I spin her in circles  that's a Gravitron

See you  you babble on so a gat is drawn
If you put her on the same level Gattas on
Fuck this battle  I just came to hit  but don't pass the bong
Cause in this rap world  rumors get passed along
Cause for years  we ain't know you rap
We just knew you from the head like how Galactus drawn

I'll battle anyone  I don't care if it's chick or man
Knock her down then ghetto soccer high  kick her cans
Beat me shit  you better have a different plan
You have no chance before you entered the ring  you Vince McMahon

I give a fuck what Bonnie is  fat broad or skinny chick
I hate everything about you  I'm a Disney flick
So get me lip  there's a round coming at you  that's frisbee shit
Fuck Bonnie  I had better options  the list be thick
You were number 66  I'm here to shoot down warriors  I'm the Lizzie clique
One shot burn her chest  that's a whisky sip
You sick of gun bars  Cool  I'm with the shit
I'll ditch the clip and kill her with no 'matic that's gypsy shit

See Bonnie  you don't got bars like that
Your bars type wack
There's a reason Math left you and he ain't march back
No I'm just playing

See I don't know the history of this woman here
To get over Math  prolly took a year
As wifey material  you prolly had him shook in fear
Cause how could he expect you to cook in the kitchen  shit you can barely cook in here

I know  I know  I know  I know
 He's using the Math angle  uh  
Of course I would  it's a planned win  you don't like it  Get a stand in
I went from the bitch Math put his hands on to the bitch put his hands in

So listen Bonnie  just shut the fuck up and own the shit
Cause everything I fucking say is true
From every rapper you fucking screw to the buzz you blew  it's nothing new
If the chain had a dick she would suck it too

Listen  here's what you do
You treated your life like a reality show til reality shows
The only person you're Punk'd is you
So I can't talk about Math  You fucking hypocrite
You made a name off the people that trusted you to please the little girl that's stuck in you
To the point you look in the mirror and wonder  Who the fuck are you  
So   who the fuck are you 

You wanna be treated like a woman  Fucking act like one
You wanna be a title contender  Fucking rap like one
You keep acting like a bitch  you'll get slapped like one
And I've been waiting to say that fucking word since I spat line one

You've been dying to battle me Danny  and it's been a long wait 
but you even look at me the wrong way and it's long blades 
See saw shank  there's no escaping this shit  it ain't Shawshank 
Now can you picture a way beyond these bars  Or is it all hate 

Desperado lawyer  my secret weapon gonna get our case 
Secret weapon  gun in a guitar case 
How we gonna deal with the shit I throw up at him 
    Howie Deal  hidden connections I invented that 

I'm on a level that you never knew 
see two dimensional rappers 
depending how it shapes up on paper can be acceptable
But 3D writers go so far in depth you can literally see what he says to you 
But I'm on a different level of writing  the fourth dimensional
Timing  it's too exceptional
I write shit you never do  some people said he's a one trick pony
Well I'm correcting you

Cause your lines gotta connect two points to be one dimensional 
you're not even that 
Die mentioning  dimensional  my name next to you
Cause it something you could never measure to

Get drugged within an inch of your life for acting all cocky
And every rapper in the world can get it
I'll get 'em all bodied to they all stop me
Why carve into his chest  For the autopsy

That's more good  morgue  news
but the coroner can't handle it another one 
You said I'm getting sloppy  I should've used a fucking gun
The cops get suspicious of what I've done
So I throw his body in the wood chipper   and let him blend in with the other ones

I'm changing the landscape Danny
Welcome to the golden age
If rap was so much better in the olden days
Then why is your favorite fucking rapper dumpster diving for my throwaways 

They're all trash and you wonder why your rep dying
You let Randy leave with the bills Bills without a Jet flying
So fucking long he changed his rap name from T Rex to Rex Ryan

But you kept trying convince us you were gang banging and block wars
Always have your word as proof  we need a lot more
You're Morgan Freeman  you narrate a story that is not yours
You've never been shot at  you've been shot towards
And we can see the difference
Those hand me down shoes you never fit in so boom
Yeah  Ah Di Boom  soon as you couldn't cry victim
You went to dry snitching to anybody who'd listen

And when they didn't  you wrote blogs instead
See I can tell you're an informant that talks to Feds
C I  Intel you're an informant that talks to Feds
You're just a rat searching for words to help the pigs
Fuck is this  Charlotte's Web 

You will burn Wilburn and for no reason you let it transpire
I will torch your soul for our sins Dan Myers
One strike then you'll witness the matchbook backfire
Scorch in eternal flames underground with this shit
Blame the devil for the other two rounds of this shit

I'll catch Gjonaj coming out his house with his whorish tramp
Put the double barrel on his eyes 'til he click the power forward  he's Horace Grant
I'll erase this bastard  that blast from the pump his face will splatter
You'll see a quarter slide away from this man like Jacob's Ladder

I caught his bitch  I cornered her
Sent her straight to the coroner
See didn't look like she was from round here  that's why I put four in her foreigner

Two Mac 11's  two  45's  am I thugging 
That's been answered  I just hope these four arms ain't spotted like skin cancer

I'll slap the fuck out you
Bitch  I need a therapist
I'll write your grandma a  fuck you  note then have it translated in Arabic

Do you believe in a parallel universe  I do
The shit is insane  peep this
My daddy was in prison playing spades while I was working on my pen game

Danny's predictable  got a bunch of name flips for Gjonaj  don't I 
You figured I'd have a Joan of Arc bar  don't lie
I'll catch you in the twilight then zone
I'm a monster on this plain
No one believes you though you see it with your own eye  Gjonaj 

I keep a K in hand just to remind you not to play with Dan 
The chopper will flip your V sideways to show you I'm greater than 

Any normal beef I'm in  the fifth get pulled
But for you  I'm on set phone with my contact in Istanbul
He's a professional at making muscles relax
He provided the materials used in a Brussels attack

But he missed his target  furthering the tensions you and I harbor
I'll pull a shotgun from a dead body and utilize armor
Your man was blown to pieces but you gon' die calmer 
my jacket colder than death  suicide bomber

Don't speak to me  bitch ass niggas  I beam frequently
When I sleep I don't see pictures I dream frequencies
I emerged from a dangerous hood a gifted spitter
Where crooked cops put they hands on a kid like Mystic River

Twisted niggas will snatch your mom  there's nothing around scarier
The instructions are simple  if she mock mach me or sound bury her barrier

You food to us  we gon' catch you and bash in your teeth
This meal is unhealthy but you savagely feast
I'll have some MS G's  MSG  spot you then clash in the streets 
then I'll make your whore moan hormone just to add to the beef

But that's not even the G Mo   GMO 
heater low run up and let the can flicker
All in his face with the Desert like   What you saying nigga    sand nigga 

Fuck you start for  
I like the art form on Bar Wars
But I didn't jump him cause what I'm building is off the wall like parkour

You must remind yourself  killing niggas is my signature
Even my autographs are a sign of death  my mind's a mess
All I think about is different ways of assaulting
Along with playing the race card and saying everything insulting

King Of The Dot  if y'all wanted to test my pen  y'all could've got the best with the flows 
Y'all could've matched me with Soul  Con'  Soul Khan   instead he'll see the specs on the nose
Your death will be cold

And you on the ground with this shit
This wack MC gotta another two rounds of this shit
Yikes 

Round 2
GJONAJ
You like those Arabic jokes huh 
Well Danny already has his foot in the grave  but in a plot twist I dug him out
Cause it's finally a Massacre in the Middle East  Americans give a fuck about 

While they genocide Christians  they're condemning a religion
While God is my witness  I must first own up to my sins to cast the first stone  Bar God

I'll kill him Sunday then ask for forgiveness
Does that make me a hypocrite 
B Dot said you got FedEx  well allow me to flip the shit
Cause if I go postal  shoot the messenger  but I didn't pay for the box I just delivered it

I'm sick enough to be admitted in a methadone clinic
But admit it  I could put on a clinic with my method
You either get it   or forget it

There's only so much you can try with logic
Then you switch to diagnostics to fiber optics
You read points  are you a Bar God or a false dying prophet 
If you ask me  you're scared to believe in anything so you die Agnostic

You got it backwards  you never read a good book and rely on technological advances
You're the same idiot praying for a tablet
It was written in stone and real soldiers know what a command meant  commandment 

Thou shall not worship a false idol
Only the Bible can rival the penmanship I've been blessed with
Every sentence  pen is effortless
Every battle I attack with a religious emphasis
Because while you were playing Sega I was reading Genesis

{Then the lights go out and the crowd loses their collective minds}

 Gjonaj 
You are not my nemesis
You are a narcissist  I am nepotist
You favor your fucking self  I favor my fucking family  it's all relative
I'm 'bout to open up a fucking museum with these skeletons

Danny  what did you tell your kids when you packed up and moved on 'em 
What about Vicky  Shell  Boom  It happens too often
Everyone close to you suffers  I'm through talking
You back stabbed everyone on Earth so I'm moonwalking

I said  did that upset you 
What about when you told Rex he died the same day as his nephew 
You sold your soul at that venue
You booked the battle  even paid for travel
You went on Smack URL and it was a favor that they let you

How could anyone respect you 
Where is your honor 
Look how you treat your own children  All they see is a monster
If Danny wasn't battle rapping  he'd never see his daughters
Imagine  having to move to Boston just to see your father

That's the power
No  that's the power behind inner and outer
For you they let out a reaction  an outer reaction
But I make it hard for 'em to breathe
In the span of four bars they feel pride  shame  hate  love  they ran out of reactions
I know longer worry if I get a reaction
They're too paralyzed by emotion to give a reaction
I'm winning simply off of inner reaction within a reaction
Inner reaction within a reaction  it's bigger than rapping
Let him have his final thoughts
Cause martyrs die for a cause  you died for a cost

DANNY MYERS
Let me guess
You're a Christian Muslim
That shit is overblown
I'll slit your throat with a cross  how's that for religious overtones

This should've been spoken on but I'm amongst the furious crowd 
surrounded by abandoned buildings and AK bullets piercing the clouds 
A corrupt government and everything near me is wild 
Bitch I'm speaking through the eyes of a Syrian child 

I've been in war  way before you came across the border clown 
My pen has shown men how to blow up 
now I'm showing them that there's more to rounds mortar rounds

The homie loaned me a used burner  he keep those thangs 
that bitch didn't come in its original case like pre owned games 
When I stash the trey  you'll be cremated to ash today 
Once the Tom stay in his mouth the gun is then Cast Away

Get your focus right 
I'll poke this knife til he's a poltergeist 
You better seek shelter in Detroit like Eminem at an open mic

You're a joke  nobody believes you're out here clapping toys
You just a bitch nigga that talks to his co workers in his rapping voice

I didn't have a choice
I ran with niggas who put niggas in the soil for me 
while you out here betting on battles with mommy and daddy's oil money

But you know the drill 
I keep fire  you can't peep Myers 
Why the fuck would y'all put the God of bar fest versus a weak writer 
I'll drive down the block looking for you  I'll spot you 
jump out  cross and sweep  that's the most basic combo in Street Fighter

But we got a lot in common  like the shit we rap about
We got a tainted mind
We sit down and paint a rhyme to express all the pain inside
But y'all notice something  Those bars  That aggression 
Ain't it mine 
Now I must kill my own creation  I'm Victor Frankenstein

You picked a dangerous time  the wrong nigga to offer the cal'
I'll punch you with the adrenaline a mother uses to lift a car off of her child
You know how somebody been dead for six minutes
And surgeons are working through a blood puddle with speed 
And then resuscitated and the first thing someone ask him is  What did you see  

Well what if it's me 
Adored in reaper's cloth 
I'll feed your thoughts that were written in the lost pages like the beepers off 

It gets deeper boss
I can't promise I will not hurt you
You just a fake mark in this field
You like a crop circle  you the jealous type
Upset that my style will beat ya
Red dots will leave spots in his scalp like Alopecia 

The devil disguises himself as your friend 
You don't even know you got the beast with you 
Niggas be walking with the pitchfork in they circle like the peace symbol 

I leave him buried in his own backyard  I got the Glocks cocked
Two bad bitches will fuck up his house like knock knock

Albanian composer  Simon Gjonaj
Does that  ring a bell to you 
Well it should  you fucking stole his identity
But what you failed to do was recreate his greatness

I got to hunt these villains
I'm giving you death out of compassion  it's like a mercy killing
First we peeling the skin off his bitch  then let the gat burst
My German dog will hit the leek with me and do his brat worse
We clap first
And he on the ground with this shit
This wack MC got a whole 'nother round of this shit
Yikes 

Round 3
GJONAJ
Now I'ma take you to the past

Said fans bagged to me slaughter names
Bagged  as in cold bodies that hand out when you wanted change
These rappers are all the same
Just empty fucking vessels that lack something
So they substitute substance with bad punches and I don't owe you a fucking thing
I'm what you had coming
But it's easy to give up everything when you have nothing

I hate the fucking expression  nothing to lose 
Is it priceless or worthless  I guess it's up to the view
See destroying your life was just something to do
But it's all sentimental  it only means something to you

I'm the black cloud on a perfect day with enough rain to drown you with
But I'm also the perfect day that surrounded it
The full map of a grand design
Just an idea trapped in a mind I can't fucking die
You don't think I've tried 
Yesterday I jumped off a fucking cliff and found out I could fly
I played Russian Roulette with a full clip and survived

I only left you alive just to suffer through the last one
A calculated risk  none of this is random
You're who the weak run to  I'm who they ran from
The people who hate my voice  don't even fucking have one

Get mutilated
Picture me stabbing a helpless victim or the hatchet hacking into him like an algorithm

A clear cut code of my own design
A basic operation where patients are prone to die
Cause I'm a neurosurgeon  I can only work with an open mind
And that's why   
An open mind  I mean try something you gon' see the other side

And that's why  in less time I'm better than you
You made a couple bad choices  I had nothing better to do than put the metal to you
Twin deuce deuces  what a catch 22

I said it's me versus you Danny
Did it really matter what league we battle on 

Sometimes you gotta take an extra step to decide what path you're on
But be careful who you step to
If you can't step up then step down and stay alive
You thought you would've stepped forward but really you were just an extra step to the side

My  how quickly Psycoses psychosis passed then reality set in before the time stopped
Paul Pierce  the truth is  sometimes you gotta take a step back for the right shot

You were in the right spot Danny  but you picked the wrong time
So it's you I gotta cut in front of everyone to skip a long line

I'm not waiting  you should've never crossed my path Myers
You knew it would get bad Myers
I didn't want to have to bag Myers
But they told me I had to kill any and every one that admires Myers

So I had to add Myers as part of my dark plan
And by the off chance you survive  I'm shooting with my off hand
Word to every fucking freckle you got  you've been a marked man

DANNY MYERS
You are fucking wack
I hope the fans had enough of you yet
Bitch  I can't die either
Just standing on my front porch is Russian Roulette

I wanna beat the shit out you
You know how someone been owing you money for like three months
Every time you see him he ain't got it
Then one day you just so happen to catch him and he out shopping 
That's when it's no longer about the money
This is easily comprehensible
Sometimes you just gotta whoop a nigga ass on principle

Bitch  I will Canelo Alvarez  right hand your soul in honor together
Along with a couple moves I stole from Conor Mcgregor
I lived in Detroit for years  on the west side  Dexter and Davison
I know niggas in Brightmoor and Inkster
I suggest you don't play with them
I freestyle battled Swan  was cool with the Dreadnaughtz
I ain't trying to exploit shit
But I ain't finna sit here and let a fake nigga tell me about some Detroit shit

Pussy
I brought a knife for you
The Glock burst for his brother
Gjonaj will be next to the blade like a Clockwork Orange cover

Elbow  right hook  then catch this knee it'll leak ya
Y'all ain't seen an Arab pussy get beat like this since Mia Khalifa

See me with a sweeper  fuck yo' album  they half do it
When this MPC see him I ain't gotta hear this Araabmuzik
This is all cerebral  a mental challenge that I have sworn to win
Fuck your religious angles  Jesus you're not battling Born again

This is me at 20%  these bars you couldn't handle fully
Hoe  a Christmas caroler couldn't hold a candle to me
I ran with bullies that'll put you on camera  don't become viral
Free Ah Di Boom cause I still rock with Jersey like Gun Titles
I'm unrivaled  absolute power  unbridled
Dumb Kyle will get shot at until it becomes idle
On my end  you'll get hit in the head with a sun dial
There gun fire before cops are called and your son dials

I'll kidnap your wife and your kid
They both part of a lesson
I gotta do this to 'em cause you both saw that aggression
I'll hold him to a fifth story window
Once the kids out the mom gon' go through it  that's postpartum depression

When they cheer for me  it gives me an energy beyond Myers
The crowd just adds to the heat  it's like a bonfire
If I ain't got the 4 5 or 12 gauge  the chopper suffice
This machine will tell you whether weather we cool or not like a Doppler device

You can get it to advance warfare  the Tec gon' shoot 
tap his ex twice  she fly across the room  she got the exo suit 
Shawn Morrison writes half your shit
Behind the scenes he puts the time in
You just play the role as the Gunman behind Shawn pen Sean Penn 

I'll walk up on him  won't say a word  then the toast lifting ya 
this silencer conversates with the dead it's like a ghost whisperer 
I'm outta here 
What's the difference between a whisper and a scream when they're both done out of fear 
I'll pull the trigger under your chin  all out in public 
put your thoughts in the sky you can think with cloudy judgement 
For the last years  I've been at every stage and I smoke writers 
and tell Hollow Da Don   you gotta see me for that G O A T  title  
And he on the ground with this shit
Thank the Lord he ain't got another round of this shit
Yikes
Let me talk to y'all before I get in my groove.
Last time I was around, I beat Realiztic in four days,
so tell me what do I got left here to prove?
I know he asked for a name but, I asked for one too,
so why the fuck did I get left here with you?
They say a closed mouth don't get fed but
Y'all gave me P Nut/peanut and now it's like an elephant's in the room
But I know, you like to freestyle right?
So what you gon' say? I'm the elephant?
Well go ahead then, come up here and front
Just know that one wrong move, I'll be an elephant to you
That just mean I'm putting Nut in the trunk
You think you King Of The Dot, I post up, waiting for him to TalkBack
He ain't think I was crazy til I'm in Nut house/nuthouse with my arms strapped
Everything you say, dick and ass, we both had DNA but I'm not that
You can try dumping me but I'm not Math
Who you kidding? My niggas use to gorillas
This half white boy die where the croc's at
You not rap, your two fans in L.A. will kill you in secs to bring 'Pac back
The Glock clap, they couldn't protect Nut with a jock strap
You got that? I can tell from your frail ass wrists you do not scrap
So get the 10 if you want
I wouldn't miss the P Nut/peanut if he leaned sideways with a top hat
Your girl? I know just where to plant her/planter
That's why y'all bugging thinking he more talented
I'll draw on him and put his frame all over the wall for the peanut gallery
Boy you fucking with great, hide your filler it's a fucking disgrace
Don't just rap nigga, be that nigga
Give me something that's ugly, that's nasty to taste
Say some shit like, "Bonnie would use your grill as a cum rag but you're used to having Nut in your face."
See that's half of the bait but y'all get slashed at a bank and still wouldn't cut to the Chase
You know what's up
Like if we had a shootout, you showing up?
Nigga even suited for war
First round he freezed next to the Cal' like Loaded Lux
So go 'head and call me a "bitch" nigga
But I'll put this bitch nigga in a cobra clutch
You think I won't crack a shell open and leave you leaking you sniffing that coca Nut/coconut
Your blood? They'll be soaking up
And here's how the story goes
The 40, blew Nut through the wall, that's a glory hole
The last nigga I battled, I'm saying that cause you a Deadman too
But anyway, the last nigga I battled, QP, yeah he was on the Maury Show
But you gon' get the First 48 and no words, just text under the table like boring dates
I cool, hell
You'll get pennies for thoughts, I move wells
So who you trying to showboat for?
I mean we all caught wind that your crew sailed
You're too frail and I don't spare shook niggas so don't you dare look bitter
This ain't lunchtime, it's crunch time
And every bone in P Nut still look brittle
So don't stare too long or knife victim, I ice pick him
You'll leave here facing more holes than The Saurus's yearbook pictures
YTG

Ayo Bonnie G
Who gon win? Prolly me
It's battle of the sexes, but say I got sloppy D it's Rocky 3
You bring a hot to the ring than Folgers, coffee beans, pop and squeeze
Hit your left and right wing; hockey team
Golly G I, give her the piece/peace that's Gandhi steez
And leave dots on her muffin like poppy seeds
I'm possibly, the wrong one to bicker with
I don't know which angle to take, but even if it's hit or miss
I'll hit a miss with the same dish she made dinner with
Fuck your Twitter pics
I got two words for you: stripper tits
You're only sexy when the liquor hits and still can't please where Richard is
Survival of the fittest
Think we fam' until I flip the script
Dig a ditch and leave a sister behind like Cinderella when the slipper fits
I'm sick of this, but it's cool, cause we ain't close
So we ain't gotta bond Bon', rub the buns Bon'
She ain't fat, she got Puffy jeans/genes that's Sean John
You fuck rappers than brag about it, my respect for you is long gone
I'll burn Bon' with the Tom Tom, I'm Don Juan
Kill the pussy then sleep inside it like a Tonton
I lock on everything from men to you, you passed Math
John John was lesson two, I ain't really trying to focus on the men and you
But it's funny how them pounds gave a trend to you
Rep your crew, YTG, used to be Innuendo
Cause we in yo' window, and if you with it, in the end you win doe
But, when do you win though?
Funny how you switch crews but still let dudes in your window
So fuck the chain, your name alone has a rep for porn
So the question forms, who's next? Ness or Born?
Chef or Storm?
Ayo Debo, it's obvious you're less informed
The only shot she deserves the Depo form
I mean ain't you heard? Less is more you attention whore
You leave black balls dry, you're a peppercorn
You used to be good, now a days your progression poor
So back it Bonnie, if you rap, you prolly seen the back of Bonnie
That's why nobody's backing Bonnie
So laugh at Bonnie cause if two tits equal a title shot, I'm attacking Bonnie
I'll pack a Tommy and split the couple like Shaq and Shaunie
Rest in peace to Caddy
Shit, now a days I'm on the same path as Ronnie
That means I'll start with one hit than give her more
If my dawgs want a piece I tell them "sic the whore"
The second she hit the floor? I give her my knee (Hermione) like Gryffindor
That's Hermione-her my knee, Gryffindor
I'll put her in the figure four
You may have battled some fucking men but you ain't seen this shit before
Time
They really flew me, back from NY to Cali, just to give you a shot
This is an actual Biggie
But whoever assist in this chapel get drawn on like this is Vatican City
You think you matching up with me?
Boy if I throw a jab to your kidney
One nip will leave you hanging like you're actual titties
The thought of you harming me, comedy
I'm not a P Nut fan
Your dogs sleeping on you holmes
It could be you and Snoop, that still wouldn't be a P Nut gang
Go run and hide, fuck who told you, you tough, your mother lied
But choose wrong and you'll lose blood like a cousin died
This fag wouldn't pop, he got the swag of a cop, I wonder why
Hmmm
Maybe you should stand next to Farrell, you been a Mark, that makes you The Other Guys
I should get you chucked off the roof
No, you might as well just run off and jump
You better Step Brother before I put Nut on a drum
But on another note, I give Nut the butter and watch the fucker choke
Calling animal cruelty how P's the (PETA) one spilling blood on his coat
PETA spill- it's aight
This outdated bastard is a Shady rapper
Like on the surface he look and ready
But inside he's really all forgiving, promotes wholesome living
And even says "no" to women
I mean you should see it
Soon as they give him a hole to dig in
He's like, "You know what? Maybe we should call it a night. I don't want to make the wrong decision."
I mean P Nut, make up your mind are you a smuck or (Smucker) not?
Do P Nut freeze up when he see the jam?
Well either hand make you fly from the Hook like Peter Pan
I give Peter, pan
Split P down to vegetable soup, I'm Progressive I keep a can
But since you look like Uncle Fester I see the reason you need a hand
I'll let my whole team do her dirty, Lebron style when I let your moms have it
These bars right here, Monday morning at welfare, the lines ratchet
And you suck on beat, you might as well blow a candle and start waxing
Cause you live the life of a pussy so bitch make your bars match it
You swear you prone to violence but complain vers' Dose that you ain't known
That's childish
I know real niggas with pops that they don't acknowledge
Who grew up broke and jobless, got hope in college
Then still graduated, broke and jobless
And you mad about rap nigga?
If you was a real black nigga, you'd know your whole fucking life gon' be a broken promise
But y'all think P Nut special right?
So go 'head with them stories and get a laugh
About QP writing for me
Or Math looking up to as a better dad
But real talk, I made myself pop, with my father's approval
Now I'm at a door (matador) so when I hear that bull I ain't never mad
Cause I know deep down inside
You just mad that I get the career that you'll never have
YTG
I said ahh
Battling Bonnie, I ain't got a bit of worry
Hit man for hire, get green over beef like chimichurri
Flip the birdy, Xcel, Dose and you
I'll make a name off the three and get a glimpse of Curry
I'm sick, if y'all think the chick can cure me, she chicken curry
She got her eyes on the chain, but her vision blurry
I'm vicious, nerdy, mean punches, the quickest flurry
That hit below the belt, like her tits at 30
Let's be real, this whole shit is gimmick worthy
I told people I'm battling Bonnie
They said, "P why? Cause if she had a dick she'd be another rapper on PY."
See I know the facts, no holding back
You could be anything in life...man, who the fuck told you that?
I mean you should be an actress with a golden plaque
Cause you play a part whenever rappers grope your back
The list goes on but let's close the gap
You can't be a model engrossed in fat
Your body you Let It Go, that's a Frozen track
Frozen tracks, you can't make a move so you're phoning Smack
Cause battling is your only outlet, you're a cul de sac
I notice that you play the gender role like the shit's corrupt
But give it up, it's not cause you're a woman that we're quick to punk
I mean listen up, if you were really top ten, you'd be listed once
But the ship has sunk
I mean yeah, you got the power to script the punch
But we don't like Lisa Leslie and that bitch can dunk!
This chick's a stunt
You fish for funk I'll rock yo' shit backwards like I missed the bus
Let's be real, you don't bring shit to this league but tits and trunk
King Of The Dot, without Bonnie it ain't missing much
Our resumes got a different touch
I rely on bodies, YOU can't catch a body so you rely on yours to build it up
But the jig is up, jiggle butt
You want a shot at the chain? How 'bout you fucking win for once?
It's probably asking a little much, but stop looking for handouts
Try being a push up bra and use your pad to lift you up
I said "fuck Bonnie", I hate you from your face to your titty tat
Your punches ain't shit, they pity pats
So gimme that, you gon' face a Hollow, like they pity Pat
See I'm a Bad Boy, tell Diddy that
50 gats coming for G-Unit like 50 raps
That semi clap? You'll get it near the bush, that's a Wrigley catch
What the fuck you gon' do? Diddly jack
Stand there and just receive the damage
You got two options, leave or vanish
I'm better than you so, I give me advantage
Who's winning? Me ho (mi hijo) I ain't speaking Spanish
You talking 'bout using my pad to life me up, right?
Well I can turn one of your lines better that you just said to show I'm dope with that
What you should've said is, I'll come through and give your whole street a round, that's a cul de sac
I seen your last battle in [?] boy
Now I'm off the Dose, let's cut the jokes
Divorced couple in bed, we ain't fucking close
Don't get it twisted like nuts and bolts
I'll give Nut the bolt but as far as nuts, I'm cutting both
I mean, I'm dealing with P Nut, right?
You've been coming out your shell lately
So I'm thinking it's time I up and roast
Why you look so salty P Nut?
Is it cause you a Finding Nemo fan
Or cause when you jerk off it squirt off and you don't even need both hands?
On top of that, we don't know if you got a baldy or a Cesar fam'
It's either like you got the worst barber or best chemo plan
How you trying to campaign for presidents if nobody knows your face?
You wanna know why you on the most underrated run ever?
Cause nobody knows your race
Like are you Haitian? Mexican? Middle Eastern? Half Caucasian?
Are you fucking, I don't know, Spanish? Portuguese? Pacific Islander? Are you Asian?
You know what? I think he's Indian cause now I'm having reservations
Like, I'm a heavyweight, sick with the skill
He featherweight, he just stick to the quill
I would say you best in the house nigga
But you was never a top pick in the field
I mean you have right? But that don't mean you can rap with niggas
And having action figures, only means you get no action, figures
Save your penmanship, derelict heritage, pace for emphasis
You could switch up your tone but you ain't the stereotype
AM feminine
Let's settle this
You were the first to get booked then brought light in the game, that's Sega Genesis
But I'm the second bitch to take you out the Family, Guy cause Mega Definite
I mean, wake up
I know, I know you hate AM (Ayem)
Every morning the hate hang over your head seeing as how you hate AM (Ayem)
But you picked the wrong night
And we gon' see if it dawn on you after I break AM (Ayem)
I'm 730 but the big hand on the .45, you'll get ate/8:00 AM (Ayem)
The Glock that I enter, like a doc with no temper
I never felt patience
.22 pinned to his head if he Hellraising
Then you know what I'ma do
Y'all know what I'ma do to P Nut?
(What?)
Put him underground with a shell casing
But you know what? You ain't even flip that shit about elephants, that's sad
You a little irrelevant bitch
That's why they see P Nut dropping now
Cause you ain't use to all that elephant shit
I ain't have to flip that elephant shit
And that cul de sac line I liked it better, see when it comes to this battle shit
We got different views, this shit is true
Your tits are what positioned you, but listen boo
I don't care if you show up butt naked to this battle, your gimmick's through
I mean yeah, sex sells but sometimes we wonder which are you?
I mean it's real talk, I came here to wig on Bonnie
Like that fucking wig on Bonnie
I said word on the street, people scared to battle Bon'
I guess I fell for that bait like the tackles strong
But this a mismatch the fashion wrong
I get it, she rapped against men so y'all clap along
Til I spin her in circles, that's a Gravitron
See you, you babble on so a gat is drawn
If you put her on the same level Gattas on
Fuck this battle, I just came to hit, but don't pass the bong
Cause in this rap world, rumors get passed along
Cause for years, we ain't know you rap
We just knew you from the head like how Galactus drawn
I'll battle anyone, I don't care if it's chick or man
Knock her down then ghetto soccer high, kick her cans
Beat me shit, you better have a different plan
You have no chance before you entered the ring, you Vince McMahon
I give a fuck what Bonnie is, fat broad or skinny chick
I hate everything about you, I'm a Disney flick
So get me lip, there's a round coming at you, that's frisbee shit
Fuck Bonnie, I had better options, the list be thick
You were number 66, I'm here to shoot down warriors, I'm the Lizzie clique
One shot burn her chest, that's a whisky sip
You sick of gun bars? Cool, I'm with the shit
I'll ditch the clip and kill her with no 'matic that's gypsy shit
See Bonnie, you don't got bars like that
Your bars type wack
There's a reason Math left you and he ain't march back
No I'm just playing
See I don't know the history of this woman here
To get over Math, prolly took a year
As wifey material, you prolly had him shook in fear
Cause how could he expect you to cook in the kitchen, shit you can barely cook in here
I know, I know, I know, I know
"He's using the Math angle, uh!"
Of course I would, it's a planned win, you don't like it? Get a stand in
I went from the bitch Math put his hands on to the bitch put his hands in
So listen Bonnie, just shut the fuck up and own the shit
Cause everything I fucking say is true
From every rapper you fucking screw to the buzz you blew, it's nothing new
If the chain had a dick she would suck it too
Listen, here's what you do
You treated your life like a reality show til reality shows
The only person you're Punk'd is you
So I can't talk about Math? You fucking hypocrite
You made a name off the people that trusted you to please the little girl that's stuck in you
To the point you look in the mirror and wonder "Who the fuck are you?"
So...who the fuck are you?
You wanna be treated like a woman? Fucking act like one
You wanna be a title contender? Fucking rap like one
You keep acting like a bitch, you'll get slapped like one
And I've been waiting to say that fucking word since I spat line one
You've been dying to battle me Danny, and it's been a long wait,
but you even look at me the wrong way and it's long blades.
See saw shank, there's no escaping this shit, it ain't Shawshank.
Now can you picture a way beyond these bars? Or is it all hate?
Desperado lawyer, my secret weapon gonna get our case.
Secret weapon, gun in a guitar case.
How we gonna deal with the shit I throw up at him?
[?] Howie Deal, hidden connections I invented that.
I'm on a level that you never knew,
see two dimensional rappers,
depending how it shapes up on paper can be acceptable
But 3D writers go so far in depth you can literally see what he says to you.
But I'm on a different level of writing, the fourth dimensional
Timing, it's too exceptional
I write shit you never do, some people said he's a one trick pony
Well I'm correcting you
Cause your lines gotta connect two points to be one dimensional,
you're not even that.
Die mentioning (dimensional) my name next to you
Cause it something you could never measure to
Get drugged within an inch of your life for acting all cocky
And every rapper in the world can get it
I'll get 'em all bodied to they all stop me
Why carve into his chest? For the autopsy
That's more good (morgue) news
but the coroner can't handle it another one.
You said I'm getting sloppy, I should've used a fucking gun
The cops get suspicious of what I've done
So I throw his body in the wood chipper...and let him blend in with the other ones
I'm changing the landscape Danny
Welcome to the golden age
If rap was so much better in the olden days
Then why is your favorite fucking rapper dumpster diving for my throwaways?
They're all trash and you wonder why your rep dying
You let Randy leave with the bills/Bills without a Jet flying
So fucking long he changed his rap name from T-Rex to Rex Ryan
But you kept trying convince us you were gang banging and block wars
Always have your word as proof, we need a lot more
You're Morgan Freeman, you narrate a story that is not yours
You've never been shot at, you've been shot towards
And we can see the difference
Those hand me down shoes you never fit in so boom
Yeah, Ah Di Boom, soon as you couldn't cry victim
You went to dry snitching to anybody who'd listen
And when they didn't, you wrote blogs instead
See I can tell you're an informant that talks to Feds
C.I. Intel you're an informant that talks to Feds
You're just a rat searching for words to help the pigs
Fuck is this? Charlotte's Web?
You will burn/Wilburn and for no reason you let it transpire
I will torch your soul for our sins Dan Myers
One strike then you'll witness the matchbook backfire
Scorch in eternal flames underground with this shit
Blame the devil for the other two rounds of this shit
I'll catch Gjonaj coming out his house with his whorish tramp
Put the double barrel on his eyes 'til he click the power forward, he's Horace Grant
I'll erase this bastard, that blast from the pump his face will splatter
You'll see a quarter slide away from this man like Jacob's Ladder
I caught his bitch, I cornered her
Sent her straight to the coroner
See didn't look like she was from round here, that's why I put four in her/foreigner
Two Mac 11's, two .45's, am I thugging?
That's been answered, I just hope these four arms ain't spotted like skin cancer
I'll slap the fuck out you
Bitch, I need a therapist
I'll write your grandma a "fuck you" note then have it translated in Arabic
Do you believe in a parallel universe? I do
The shit is insane, peep this
My daddy was in prison playing spades while I was working on my pen game
Danny's predictable, got a bunch of name flips for Gjonaj, don't I?
You figured I'd have a Joan of Arc bar, don't lie
I'll catch you in the twilight then zone
I'm a monster on this plain
No one believes you though you see it with your own eye (Gjonaj)
I keep a K in hand just to remind you not to play with Dan.
The chopper will flip your V sideways to show you I'm greater than.
Any normal beef I'm in, the fifth get pulled
But for you? I'm on set phone with my contact in Istanbul
He's a professional at making muscles relax
He provided the materials used in a Brussels attack
But he missed his target, furthering the tensions you and I harbor
I'll pull a shotgun from a dead body and utilize armor
Your man was blown to pieces but you gon' die calmer,
my jacket colder than death, suicide bomber
Don't speak to me, bitch ass niggas, I beam frequently
When I sleep I don't see pictures I dream frequencies
I emerged from a dangerous hood a gifted spitter
Where crooked cops put they hands on a kid like Mystic River
Twisted niggas will snatch your mom, there's nothing around scarier
The instructions are simple, if she mock/mach me or sound bury her/barrier
You food to us, we gon' catch you and bash in your teeth
This meal is unhealthy but you savagely feast
I'll have some MS G's (MSG) spot you then clash in the streets,
then I'll make your whore moan/hormone just to add to the beef
But that's not even the G Mo. (GMO)
heater low run up and let the can flicker
All in his face with the Desert like, "What you saying nigga?" (sand nigga)
Fuck you start for?"
I like the art form on Bar Wars
But I didn't jump him cause what I'm building is off the wall like parkour
You must remind yourself, killing niggas is my signature
Even my autographs are a sign of death, my mind's a mess
All I think about is different ways of assaulting
Along with playing the race card and saying everything insulting
King Of The Dot, if y'all wanted to test my pen, y'all could've got the best with the flows.
Y'all could've matched me with Soul, Con' (Soul Khan), instead he'll see the specs on the nose
Your death will be cold
And you on the ground with this shit
This wack MC gotta another two rounds of this shit
Yikes!
You like those Arabic jokes huh?
Well Danny already has his foot in the grave, but in a plot twist I dug him out
Cause it's finally a Massacre in the Middle East, Americans give a fuck about.
While they genocide Christians, they're condemning a religion
While God is my witness, I must first own up to my sins to cast the first stone, Bar God
I'll kill him Sunday then ask for forgiveness
Does that make me a hypocrite?
B Dot said you got FedEx, well allow me to flip the shit
Cause if I go postal, shoot the messenger, but I didn't pay for the box I just delivered it
I'm sick enough to be admitted in a methadone clinic
But admit it, I could put on a clinic with my method
You either get it...or forget it
There's only so much you can try with logic
Then you switch to diagnostics to fiber optics
You read points, are you a Bar God or a false dying prophet?
If you ask me, you're scared to believe in anything so you die Agnostic
You got it backwards, you never read a good book and rely on technological advances
You're the same idiot praying for a tablet
It was written in stone and real soldiers know what a command meant (commandment)
Thou shall not worship a false idol
Only the Bible can rival the penmanship I've been blessed with
Every sentence, pen is effortless
Every battle I attack with a religious emphasis
Because while you were playing Sega I was reading Genesis
{Then the lights go out and the crowd loses their collective minds}
[Gjonaj]
You are not my nemesis
You are a narcissist, I am nepotist
You favor your fucking self, I favor my fucking family, it's all relative
I'm 'bout to open up a fucking museum with these skeletons
Danny, what did you tell your kids when you packed up and moved on 'em?
What about Vicky? Shell? Boom? It happens too often
Everyone close to you suffers, I'm through talking
You back stabbed everyone on Earth so I'm moonwalking
I said, did that upset you?
What about when you told Rex he died the same day as his nephew?
You sold your soul at that venue
You booked the battle, even paid for travel
You went on Smack/URL and it was a favor that they let you
How could anyone respect you?
Where is your honor?
Look how you treat your own children? All they see is a monster
If Danny wasn't battle rapping, he'd never see his daughters
Imagine, having to move to Boston just to see your father
That's the power
No, that's the power behind inner and outer
For you they let out a reaction, an outer reaction
But I make it hard for 'em to breathe
In the span of four bars they feel pride, shame, hate, love, they ran out of reactions
I know longer worry if I get a reaction
They're too paralyzed by emotion to give a reaction
I'm winning simply off of inner reaction within a reaction
Inner reaction within a reaction, it's bigger than rapping
Let him have his final thoughts
Cause martyrs die for a cause, you died for a cost
Let me guess
You're a Christian Muslim
That shit is overblown
I'll slit your throat with a cross, how's that for religious overtones
This should've been spoken on but I'm amongst the furious crowd,
surrounded by abandoned buildings and AK bullets piercing the clouds.
A corrupt government and everything near me is wild.
Bitch I'm speaking through the eyes of a Syrian child.
I've been in war, way before you came across the border clown.
My pen has shown men how to blow up,
now I'm showing them that there's more to rounds/mortar rounds
The homie loaned me a used burner, he keep those thangs,
that bitch didn't come in its original case like pre-owned games.
When I stash the trey, you'll be cremated to ash today;
Once the Tom stay in his mouth the gun is then Cast Away
Get your focus right.
I'll poke this knife til he's a poltergeist.
You better seek shelter in Detroit like Eminem at an open mic
You're a joke, nobody believes you're out here clapping toys
You just a bitch nigga that talks to his co-workers in his rapping voice
I didn't have a choice
I ran with niggas who put niggas in the soil for me,
while you out here betting on battles with mommy and daddy's oil money
But you know the drill.
I keep fire, you can't peep Myers.
Why the fuck would y'all put the God of bar fest versus a weak writer?
I'll drive down the block looking for you, I'll spot you,
jump out, cross and sweep, that's the most basic combo in Street Fighter
But we got a lot in common, like the shit we rap about
We got a tainted mind
We sit down and paint a rhyme to express all the pain inside
But y'all notice something? Those bars? That aggression?
Ain't it mine?
Now I must kill my own creation, I'm Victor Frankenstein
You picked a dangerous time, the wrong nigga to offer the cal'
I'll punch you with the adrenaline a mother uses to lift a car off of her child
You know how somebody been dead for six minutes
And surgeons are working through a blood puddle with speed?
And then resuscitated and the first thing someone ask him is "What did you see?"
Well what if it's me?
Adored in reaper's cloth,
I'll feed your thoughts that were written in the lost pages like the beepers off.
It gets deeper boss
I can't promise I will not hurt you
You just a fake mark in this field
You like a crop circle, you the jealous type
Upset that my style will beat ya
Red dots will leave spots in his scalp like Alopecia.
The devil disguises himself as your friend.
You don't even know you got the beast with you.
Niggas be walking with the pitchfork in they circle like the peace symbol.
I leave him buried in his own backyard, I got the Glocks cocked
Two bad bitches will fuck up his house like knock knock
Albanian composer; Simon Gjonaj
Does that, ring a bell to you?
Well it should, you fucking stole his identity
But what you failed to do was recreate his greatness
I got to hunt these villains
I'm giving you death out of compassion, it's like a mercy killing
First we peeling the skin off his bitch, then let the gat burst
My German dog will hit the leek with me and do his brat worse
We clap first
And he on the ground with this shit
This wack MC got a whole 'nother round of this shit
Yikes!
Now I'ma take you to the past
Said fans bagged to me slaughter names
Bagged, as in cold bodies that hand out when you wanted change
These rappers are all the same
Just empty fucking vessels that lack something
So they substitute substance with bad punches and I don't owe you a fucking thing
I'm what you had coming
But it's easy to give up everything when you have nothing
I hate the fucking expression "nothing to lose"
Is it priceless or worthless? I guess it's up to the view
See destroying your life was just something to do
But it's all sentimental, it only means something to you
I'm the black cloud on a perfect day with enough rain to drown you with
But I'm also the perfect day that surrounded it
The full map of a grand design
Just an idea trapped in a mind I can't fucking die
You don't think I've tried?
Yesterday I jumped off a fucking cliff and found out I could fly
I played Russian Roulette with a full clip and survived
I only left you alive just to suffer through the last one
A calculated risk, none of this is random
You're who the weak run to, I'm who they ran from
The people who hate my voice, don't even fucking have one
Get mutilated
Picture me stabbing a helpless victim or the hatchet hacking into him like an algorithm
A clear cut code of my own design
A basic operation where patients are prone to die
Cause I'm a neurosurgeon, I can only work with an open mind
And that's why...
An open mind, I mean try something you gon' see the other side
And that's why, in less time I'm better than you
You made a couple bad choices, I had nothing better to do than put the metal to you
Twin deuce deuces, what a catch 22
I said it's me versus you Danny
Did it really matter what league we battle on?
Sometimes you gotta take an extra step to decide what path you're on
But be careful who you step to
If you can't step up then step down and stay alive
You thought you would've stepped forward but really you were just an extra step to the side
My, how quickly Psycoses/psychosis passed then reality set in before the time stopped
Paul Pierce, the truth is, sometimes you gotta take a step back for the right shot
You were in the right spot Danny, but you picked the wrong time
So it's you I gotta cut in front of everyone to skip a long line
I'm not waiting, you should've never crossed my path Myers
You knew it would get bad Myers
I didn't want to have to bag Myers
But they told me I had to kill any and every one that admires/Myers
So I had to add Myers as part of my dark plan
And by the off chance you survive, I'm shooting with my off hand
Word to every fucking freckle you got, you've been a marked man
You are fucking wack
I hope the fans had enough of you yet
Bitch, I can't die either
Just standing on my front porch is Russian Roulette
I wanna beat the shit out you
You know how someone been owing you money for like three months
Every time you see him he ain't got it
Then one day you just so happen to catch him and he out shopping?
That's when it's no longer about the money
This is easily comprehensible
Sometimes you just gotta whoop a nigga ass on principle
Bitch, I will Canelo Alvarez, right hand your soul in honor together
Along with a couple moves I stole from Conor Mcgregor
I lived in Detroit for years, on the west side, Dexter and Davison
I know niggas in Brightmoor and Inkster
I suggest you don't play with them
I freestyle battled Swan, was cool with the Dreadnaughtz
I ain't trying to exploit shit
But I ain't finna sit here and let a fake nigga tell me about some Detroit shit
Pussy
I brought a knife for you
The Glock burst for his brother
Gjonaj will be next to the blade like a Clockwork Orange cover
Elbow, right hook, then catch this knee it'll leak ya
Y'all ain't seen an Arab pussy get beat like this since Mia Khalifa
See me with a sweeper, fuck yo' album, they half do it
When this MPC/see him I ain't gotta hear this Araabmuzik
This is all cerebral, a mental challenge that I have sworn to win
Fuck your religious angles, Jesus you're not battling Born again
This is me at 20%, these bars you couldn't handle fully
Hoe, a Christmas caroler couldn't hold a candle to me
I ran with bullies that'll put you on camera, don't become viral
Free Ah Di Boom cause I still rock with Jersey like Gun Titles
I'm unrivaled, absolute power, unbridled
Dumb Kyle will get shot at until it becomes idle
On my end, you'll get hit in the head with a sun dial
There gun fire before cops are called and your son dials
I'll kidnap your wife and your kid
They both part of a lesson
I gotta do this to 'em cause you both saw that aggression
I'll hold him to a fifth story window
Once the kids out the mom gon' go through it, that's postpartum depression
When they cheer for me, it gives me an energy beyond Myers
The crowd just adds to the heat, it's like a bonfire
If I ain't got the 4-5 or 12 gauge, the chopper suffice
This machine will tell you whether/weather we cool or not like a Doppler device
You can get it to advance warfare, the Tec gon' shoot,
tap his ex twice, she fly across the room, she got the exo suit.
Shawn Morrison writes half your shit
Behind the scenes he puts the time in
You just play the role as the Gunman behind Shawn pen/Sean Penn.
I'll walk up on him, won't say a word, then the toast lifting ya,
this silencer conversates with the dead it's like a ghost whisperer.
I'm outta here.
What's the difference between a whisper and a scream when they're both done out of fear?
I'll pull the trigger under your chin, all out in public,
put your thoughts in the sky you can think with cloudy judgement.
For the last years, I've been at every stage and I smoke writers,
and tell Hollow Da Don, "you gotta see me for that G.O.A.T. title."
And he on the ground with this shit
Thank the Lord he ain't got another round of this shit
Yikes!
Between battling at BlackOut or in Cali, this could only be in one place.
So I’ma beam you up; I hope your son can read the updates.
I knew you’d get your second chance to meet with Jesus some way,
but you hadn’t crossed me yet, so why would I go east to son Day(Easter Sunday)?
The floodgates are open; better flee that ship.
Everyone I’m with(-)draw, like a rehab stint.
No cheap antics, just rap from me; that’s it.
Three rounds in your face, on some ski mask shit.
You ain’t never been served like this,
and I put every single word I spit on Irvine Crip.
Sight locked on my target; they brought y’all a marksman.
I’m perched up at Lee Harvey Oswald’s apartment.
They said I can’t punch with him, but if I knock off his jaw, then
he gon’ hear me break it in like the watchdog is barking.
I’ll shut Day’s clock off so it’s not so alarming,
when I stop Spawn from starting like I shot Todd McFarlane.
Fuck it; I’m in monster mode. Card shark; the water’s cold.
Wash and fold Day like I got the day off: office closed.
I’ve got it locked. Player one, let the cartridge load,
game on, I’ll catch thirty to life like the Contra code.
Try me. I’ll show up to son’s front porch, and
put rounds on the house like I just uncorked it.
My right’s so well-known I got a plus one for it,
to drop Lyt(light) all night. I don’t think son(sun)’s up for it.
Of course there’d be a chance he came with antics; Day’s an anarchist.
But if he did, then shit, I got one too. Get Day an ambulance.
He been dead since the day that Day was handed this.
Now, give Day a hand, and pay the data analyst
it’s gonna take for Day to handle this.
Half your battles, you’re the dopest rapper that I’ve seen.
The other half, you do shit that’s a cancer to the scene.
So keep that shit in mind next time you get all costumed up:
what Lyt does outside the West still reflects on all of us.
Personally, I believe no battle rapper is perfect. We all did some damage.
We all done put people in a situation where they get to cheer,
and some where y’all get to panic.
I done created so many people in my head, people may call it genius,
and some may say it’s what they call schizophrenic.
I’d like to sacrifice this first round just to talk to my antics.
I look all my fans in the eyes and say I’m sorry for the P. Diddy blog.
I’m sorry for the gay shit.
I’m sorry for losing the title shot; I’m sorry for the slave fit.
I’m sorry for walking out on Rone; that shit was bad for my damn health,
and to show y’all how sorry I am for the Loe Pesci battle,
I’m about to wipe ball sweat on my damn self.
But wait, y’all didn’t get the elbow.
I didn’t wipe ball sweat on my face ‘cause I had doubts to blow up.
I wiped ball sweat on my face ‘cause I’m about to go nuts.
I been living in a dope situation, and it’s not a crack house.
I’m back ‘cause I got to wig on these college kids;
start bucking inside their frat mouth.
The “keep it going” style was colder than Big Shirley, but surely,
niggas put their hands on the flow(floor) like they tried to tap out.
Pussy fight: let me see what these cats ‘bout.
It’s a campout: I’ll send him fire. It’ll be the same enemy as taking the bat route.
Think Bane: these mouth bars, they got to face it.
Fact, they Draked it. They sent us back to Back to the Basics,
but yet I’ll still fitting to Black(-)Out.
Why do they book gods versus these baby fruit flies?
And I get to burying maggots.
I’ll put him underground for free like Harriet traffic.
Get planted soon as they told you they would let us(lettuce) in the ring,
and soon to find out he married a cabbage.
What, y’all ain’t get it? I’ll leave his wife vegetable.
We set fire to any female carrying static.
That’s the price you got to pay for being the wife of an aryan faggot.
These words is stone like the Sumerian tablets.
I’ll put holmes in a hole, like damn, he a rabbit.
Fuck what you done. Give your crew tons(croutons);
leave them all vegetable. They can be a salad.
The land we abandon. Hand me a band and
I’ll go for the steal, like damn, he a bandit.
The best Day. You couldn’t rest Day if you hand me the sabbath.
You would(wood) handle me; if you can, be a cabinet.
Metal arms to his top: man see the Gadget.
I was the first on Earth saying(saiyan) shit like this.
Damn, he the raddest(Raditz).
The plan be the stratosphere in here with the—
(time called)

You ‘bout to get everybody in your pod casted. I am a Dirt.
You’ll get hit with everything, from nines to fives. I am a work.
I’ll leave you neck-less(necklace); I’ll put my Life on that. I am Alert.
You can feel it in your chest, I got this body covered. I am a shirt.
Yo, Day, how come lately you’ve been lazier with your writing than ever?
I got something hot(-)headed your way. I am a temper.
You said, “I am a looper”, “I am a worm”, “I am the Bart”, “I am a render.”
Come on, man. You used to be way better than this. I am remember.
Pretend you’re a grown man; your word’s worth more than weight.
This ain’t a turf war with great, but I’ll turn Norman Bates.
I got a dozen extra rounds I’m too dirt poor to waste,
and got away with murder after the first four D ate(First 48).
That shit is so easy to do, I wrote this one round for you, dog.
The metal I bring to the table leaves you spun ‘round: that’s foosball.
This Kombat will chop cats; I’ll Kung Lao your roof off.
How can we trust Daylyt when son(sun) down to moon y’all?
Now, I got something cold in the chamber: cryogenically.
Agent K: I’ll flash on Day and wipe y’all’s memory.
I don’t need shine, so why the fuck is Lyt(light) on next to me?
What the fuck’s a Day got to a lifelong legacy?
Nothing. I’m getting gold, closing the loop.
Uppercut: skylight. Put a hole in your roof.
I was gonna talk about all of the accomplishments that you’ve blown playing hoops,
but I didn’t want this round to start getting emotional. Oops(Ooops).
Now you know that you can’t dodge your punishment and payback.
You want to blow someday? Well, Puffy can arrange that.
Your pen’s more shaky than the one that did your face tat.
I’ll catch a case over this like a Money in the Bank match.
At one point in time, niggas used to think the Earth was flat, until Columbus came.
Y’all let a mass murderer tell y’all anything, and y’all believe it.
In the end(Indian), he left everybody dead, cold blooded,
and that’s when the game got anemic,
‘cause the white sails(cells) went sky-high.
You folks left the glue coast(glucose), and I got to free these niggas.
First shot from the index, then blood spill;
whoever’s gonna die ‘a be these(diabetes) niggas,
thinking life too sweet.
The pencil insulin fight dude. I ain’t the type to(two) text a nigga.
Organik pack the card and I deads a nigga.
Everybody get chewed: Hannibal Lecter nigga.
I Do this write(Right) Thing: I’m Spike Lee;
Nike: every step, I got to check them niggas.
You come in testing(intestine) me, but I can’t stomach their lines.
I got a gut feeling I’m ‘bout to wreck them(rectum) niggas.
You gassed, trick(gastric). Fuck around and get bypassed if I pass you by.
They asked you try to be tier(tear), and you just end up being the last who cry.
My big homie say,
“fuck the money. Take every opportunity you get, ‘cause this life’ll pass you by.”
I’m from the era where you had to go nuts.
It ain’t matter how much cash you(cashew) got.
All men(almond) get snapped on. The deacon peeking (pecan),
but they’ll depict the killers.
In Watts, they was raising(raisin) nuts. Soon as I hopped on the trail, mixing niggas.
To get to the top action, we see niggas like TheSaurus, we not rapping.
We give them the best mouth beat in the world: Scott Jackson.
But I been wigging since a youngster, O.J. Mayo type.
Mayo white, but I black the Bayo type.
Fifty cents(50 Cent), we wave hands in his face: Tony Yayo night.
I prey your type. Harder to slash at you: Halo knife.
So many guns, nigga, this shit gon’ look like a Halo fight.
Think Day go light, I snap on these squares perfect; nigga, I’m Lego nice.
You wouldn’t get a piece of this small round with a Bagel Bite.
Day gon’ fight. Two shots, just body. The lower half, still there; the top half, real flat.
Before the shot, Pat Stay. After the shot, Illmac.
I’m back. I’m back. You feel the spine,
but before I go in, Malathion, time? (Time.)

That Solomon battle was weird.
I Remember the Time when you said you wanted to Make a Change,
and right then, the example was clear.
That match was reflective of Michael Jackson’s career:
nothing Black or White, just standing there
watching something so bad from The Man In the Mirror.
You think you bodied Iron, but listen. That’s something I’d like to revisit.
The irony is that your ego’s so easily bruised because Lyt’s really iron deficient.
But now Day thinks he’s gonna son me, like I am the infant?
I’ll take flight on Daylyt like sky is the limit.
In a minute, the game’s changing. I’m fitting to body: waist training.
Son(sun) facing the crack of don(dawn); now Day breaking.
I ain’t got to try hard. Yeah, I got some light(Lyt) bars,
but in one shift, I’ll punch into Day like a timecard.
Clock it. Try not to misuse your minutes, or this dude is finished.
Just stick to your gimmicks. Your fucking tattoo looks like shit, dude, admit it.
You are Spawn from the comics: you’ve got issues with Image.
I’m sick of all the extra shit, though. It’s sad ‘cause you’re way talented,
but the example that you set as a man? Well, I ain’t down with it.
Tell me, a decade from now, you gonna act like you ain’t proud of it
when you ask your son how he did on his SATs
and he says he antic’ed his way out of it?
I knew it was a risk, but this battle was me taking my own chances,
so when they ask why, I’ll say the same thing I told ‘ganik.
Day could be the best in the game if he goes back
to the way that he rapped before all the fame had him so famished.
Now he looks for any card he can play and he goes Gambit,
but he ain’t even notice his ace in the hole vanished.
Every match, you should show up in the same thing you rocked against Pat
when you went for the chain, ‘cause you’re a slave to your own antics.
DAYLYT
Third round is when I let the heat blow fast.
Organik, you stop me time this time, I’ma beat yo ass.
We could’ve had a hardwood classic,
a throwback: old jersey, sure(Jersey Shore), but I don’t rock with Snooki.
This when I got to tuck the lead for these knuckleheads,
but I ain’t forgot the noogie.
A three-round barfest, yes, but this is when I got to stop the goodie,
‘cause when I look at your face, all I can remember is
when Locksmith said you look like a Chewbacca woodie.
You looked at me and said, “mmmm,” and did this awkward boogie.
But that’s back when you and Okwerdz was popping,
and the top of the hip hop was true.
The leaders of the backpackers,
telling the world a Smack rapper is what not to do.
I remember they followed you. I read my Locksmith comments,
like “this wack Smack rapper.” That shit left me with hurt pride,
knowing I was the only street rapper in G.T.,
and y’all labeled me one of the worst guys,
but yet the worst ride from first prize:
the same niggas who had multis now all rap about how they gon’ hurt guys.
Facts. I just seen a battle where Reverse Live said, “I’ma squirt nines.”
Had me like, “are you serious?” But that’s what your people do.
Y’all make the world hate us for something we do,
then y’all do it and make it look cool.
That’s when the plan unfold.
Prime example: Sir Mix-a-Lot video, “ew, Becky, look at her butt.”
Now every white bitch want to look like Amber Rose.
Nigga, we created everything, but y’all take it, and leave us demanding for respect.
Speaking of Amber Rose,
I would give you white bitches the finger, but(t), Organik cut my check.
I should go for the mark-out, but all they gon’ say is, “how come I’m testing you”.
This shit about to Okwerdz,
‘cause it’s fitting to be a one-rhyming, gun-lining punchline festival.
If it’s a party, hand me my grand baggy grab bag.
They told me Ron died, I was mad Caddy fast passed.
The hand scrammy blam blam, shoot his granddaddy grand dad,
two fives on side his face: naa nanny naa naa.
It's the most underrated. Underhanded, I oversaw,
‘cause being overlooked creates a pen that's over all.
It's a love/hate relationship with the crowd. I know it's wrong,
but it's just a troll to control the fans, so all in all,
this is a helping hand to bring strength to a cast that I seen would break all along.
Listen to me Corey. I mean, basically what I'm saying is, you're the weakest link.
Oh, what? What y’all think, he fire?
'Til I roll up in this joint like E-Z Widers
going overboard to air you through the tube like deep sea divers.
Wait a minute. Who the fuck y'all thought I was battling, Darrell?
Oh, so what, y'all think he liver?
Mind of a serial killer,
I've been aiming to put an Arsonal in the trunk: I'm the D.C. sniper.
Wait a minute. What else rhymes with "the D.C. Sniper"? B.E.T. Cipher.
So, wait a minute. You won each week and so what? Now y'all think he liver?
Dios mio, in the spirit of Chris Rios, he speaks nada.
I'm a beast, woken up out his deep sleep, fire in his eyes.
I'm alive, and you gon' greet me sire, or you'll meet messiah.
These sixteens get put to rest for trying to sleep with tiger(Tyga)s.
Reality shows he's not a threat; dog’s a liar.
You pulling straps out and marking dudes in battles with no thoughts inspired,
doing dumb, dickhead, white boy shit, and that'll get your jaw rewired.
I wish you would(wood) spark.
I'm from the jungle, so if the heat wave it's cause the four is(forest) fire.
It's a wrap if we talking that loud. Meet Meek,
I'm in the trap, drilling over the base(bass) like Chief Keef.
Head shot - bang. Brains on the horn - beep, beep,
‘cause ain't no seeing Cort’(court): cheap seats.
I can out rap all you chumps. All you front, then all you slumped.
Brooklyn, that's where Cor' is from,
with a dummy waiting to bust(bus) a whole clip like Forest Gump.
It's time that I black out; you lack props.
What y'all did, wave a steak right in front of a have-not?
Think, a disguise on Cort’(court) ain't a mascot,
and since y'all pushing buttons, it's only right I turn Blackout into Black Ops.
‘Cause I control the game; no, scratch that.
I control the game; I'll school you Corey.
Look, don't love 'em, just fuck 'em. Just fuck 'em and leave 'em,
don't hug 'em and squeeze 'em,
but, when it come to the bitches, we can tell the honeys mislead him.
Aw, man. Your stats dropped; you're a bad cop because you cuff for no reason.
As far as Black Entertainment Television goes as a whole,
well, bro, they disrespected you.
Plus Arsonal mushed you in your face; Pat Stay damn near molested you.
So what’d you do? You whined and complained, and that's why son getting dealt.
You came back to the States trying to rep Grapes and fuck with the belt.
Then K-Shine's palm proved them punches in the ring did nothing to help,
so how can a country stand behind a man
who doesn't have the balls to stand up for himself?
You mean to tell me you won on national television and didn't even have a contact?
You're white, and you're privileged.
Your rich ass daddy ain't teach you nothing about a contract?
Nonsense. He doesn't know about fine prints?
Fine, bitch. Your death certificate is getting signed, stitched,
and I sense the hatred. It's great, kid; I'm ceasing the weak.
Body language, obituaries: you can read it, then weep.
And like I said, I appreciate y'all reaching out,
but wait 'til round three, there's some shit we gotta speak about.
Hat's off to my last opponent,
but I ain't come here to make excuses or rap some bullshit.
See, when I deal with the smack, I stood there insulted;
when you deal with the Smack, the footage gets vaulted.
URL knows you're a bird; they don't upload your battles.
They vault your(vulture) footage like the Discovery Channel.
You rap 'bout pushing work and how you scheming crazy.
I'll rap 'bout it too, even if the people hate me.
Putting ops on payroll, even the police will pay me.
I got cops dropping kis(keys) off in my room like Steven Avery.
But that ain't me. I'm reserved, polite and ain't good in fights.
I keep it a hundred, like Cortez's booking price.
But wait, you're top tier? Your battles are fucking torture.
The day you're top tier is the day you jump the border
in a shirt that says "proud Trump supporter”.
Your girl's pussy was lose; she had to start to give dome.
That girl gargled Charron. She was choking so hard she pulled out Arsonal's phone.
But I didn't want Coytez. I want to body Tay.
No Jay Hova, but I'll Takeover when I put Roc(-)away.
I've seen the way you do it, and it's not the same.
They gon' feel the pressure on cam(Cam) and see him drop the ball;
this is how the Broncos play.
I'll break him down; you won't want to play.
I'll have you feeling like Meek Mill on Boxing Day.
Your slogan is “top tier money”. You do not get paid.
Who thinks he gets that Lux, Mook and Hollow pay?
You lie like a politician 'bout your top tier pay.
It ain't true dough, you talking about the side of your mouth like Jean Chrétien.
Caustic exposed he couldn't smash ‘cause he was limp.
Listen, penis shrimp, you shouldn't have dissed Bruce B, you bitch,
but the theme of the needle fits, ‘cause you have such a needle dick,
when you beat a chick it's considered an intravenous hit.
His favorite band? Limp Bizkit. But I'll cut it out quick.
You can't tell jokes, you have to act tough when you spit.
I dare you to shoot me; I’ll just rebuttal that shit.
So let me guess, if someone put hands on you, you gon' fight.
I'm laughing at this situation, it's so light.
Since birth, I've been pushed into lockers and hit with cold rights.
I should be running the Ultimate Rap League,
because I've been getting Smacked my whole life.
This is how his first round sounded.
"I'm in an aggressive mood, when I sketch in you, then I step to you, like Tekken—“
Yo, why the fuck do you rap like that?
I guess y'all figured this would be a waste of a round,
and that would be perhaps why y'all would think I would slack like that,
but it's not in my DNA, so I'm gonna separate you from the gap like that,
and the last time here I cook 'cane, so it's only right I come back like crack.
Now my name at one point was right here; it don't get no higher, cuz.
Y'all all thought I fell off and my career was nearly dying, cuz,
but now I'm back from the dead, it's the Lazarus Effect.
Y'all don't get it, y'all ain't even see me rising up
so wisen up, you idle up, you idol us,
or I'll surprise him out of nowhere with this gift like secret admirers.
I am(I.M.) just well-received like mobile phones,
grilling white boy in his mouth like Post Malone.
Whoa. It costs to be the boss and the throne's my home,
so if I let you get a(-)head, it's only so I can add it to my totem pole.
Whoa. The very second I'ma set it in action of every second I'm clapping,
you’ll get bucks after it fire; that's a severance package.
I came here for one reason: to stop the lesson.
In a class all by myself, yet it's not detention.
Hollow tips like Rone vers’ Pat Stay: these rounds is comple(i)menting,
with add-ons fully equipped. I hope you got your weapons,
techs(text) blue, get left red. Oh now you got the message,
and he's talking reckless. Fuck it, pass me the tool.
Stupid, clips on Cort(court) like Shaqtin’ a Fool.
Fuck it, I don't even need gun bars to beat him ’til my hands get a bruise.
The way I drug him over the border, he could pass for a mule.
Now let's take some things into account. Nevertheless,
I bring balance here, so go 'head and check. You're forever in debt.
Insufficient. I mean I can't get no lesser than this,
and though my name's on the card, I get no credit for this?
And that's why I need to know, who planted this fucking seed to grow?
‘Cause you? It's unbelievable how you achieve with style that's unbelievable.
I mean, Shotgun Suge tapped your pockets in front of Smack and them,
then K-Shine's palm put you right back on Smack again.
I mean, I ain't even mad that you got slapped, and that's a fact, ‘cause shit happens.
But I'm more mad at the fact that after you got slapped.. Bro, you kept rapping.
Plus DNA and K-Shine 3-0'd you. Both of y'all. You ain't learn your lesson by now?
I got a question for pal. How you come with 100 Bulletz, but ain't get you a round?
Wow. But I'ma save that for later; I appreciate y'all reaching out,
and round three’s next. There's some shit we gotta speak about.
(Out.)
This event is strictly for top tier. You gotta book them for their bars,
so you do have a secret admirer, ‘cause no one knows who put you on this card.
Yo, my hotel crazy. The squad gets savage.
Carter Deems jumping on the bed popping rachets
Your hotel don't even got a mattress.
All you have's a couch; Organik got you the Total Slaughter package.
But that's how Brooklyn do. Every time I look at you,
I see the couch you slept on after Rex started cooking you.
You came in last place. Everyone made mad cake.
You spent more time on the couch than the guy from Half Baked.
I saw your battle with Jimz, watched it on blu-ray.
You said, "I had to pop myself.” My TV paused for like two days.
Spit your gun bars; I ain't gon' lie 'bout how I gotta let my tool spray.
If I took a Shotty out, it's of retirement, to catch a body in the U.K.
You have a S.T.D., Cor’. Bet it's stressful to piss.
Now he picks up girls online at Plentyofitch.
A girl you smashed hit me up; I rejected her quick,
‘cause as soon as Cor' in her(coroner), I wouldn't be caught dead with that bitch.
This Canadian's so big, it might offend a Bender.
You died from Rex(wrecks); this is more than a fender bender.
They resurrected Ledger, the second Dexter,
Professor Lecter perfecting lectures in tracheotomies next semester,
my pen will enter this candy rapper 'til his neck's dismembered,
and something pops out his throat, now that's a 'Tez Dispenser.
But we could take this to the stage if you want war with Corey.
I'll have my whole team waiting at the border for me.
You won't see Lady Gaga in a hotel, but it'll get more than gory
when I bring killers to Cortez; that's an American Horror Story.
I hate when you tell the crowd what you're doing to make it look easy.
Funny you faced G.O.D. and 'Cane but ain't able(Abel) to beat me.
(Wordplay.)
But if I ain't down with you, I'll put the pound to you
and shoot everyone surrounding you.
(Aggression.)
Do you talk like that in real life?
He came up to me like, “I was with this girl last night. Her name was Jasmine.
I almost got it in, but I just couldn't make it happen.”
(Erectile dysfunction.)
But fuck the jokes. More gangster, monster. Grown man, Mossberg.
Desert Eagle; they call me The Bird Man.
I'm shooting with two hands, aiming on one knee; I aim at you, and hit the lady in 1D.
Those aren't my bars. I’m not even saying it right;
I'm just spitting a T-Rex mixtape verse before he does later tonight.
Now what more I got to do? I'm talking to you.
I haven't lost clearly in years, and yet I still get lost in the views,
and often I'm screwed, so I need y'all all to listen to these thoughts that I spew,
‘cause this wasn't a step down, it was a step-to, just so you can walk in my shoes.
Now, what, more, I gotta do? You should ask yourself, in fact,
because you’ve done a lot for King Of The Dot with unselfish acts,
but how can you separate from a league that always welcomes Pat
while you're always left out in the cold and being stepped over as a welcome mat?
I can help with that.
First off, grow a fucking set of balls. Second off, grow a fucking spine.
Third, be a fucking man, start fighting back.
‘Cause how the fuck you chase a chain for five years,
and let a nigga change your third round and you ain't fight for that?
I mean, despite the fact you spent weeks and days writing raps,
all you did was prove you been a slave to the chain way before Daylyt and Pat.
Hold on.
You chased the fucking chain, for what? Five years?
“Wahh, Pat made me change my third,” and you cried tears?
What happened to all that Grape Street cripping, cuz?
Yo, that's how you know, look at the bullshit we allow.
There's a big difference between you fucking spitting in a round
and him fucking spitting and punching you in a round.
I mean, you represent everything I see wrong with battle rap today
You pull out straps like it's a joke, purple flags like that's live;
it's bad vibes, Corey, it's sad, why?
‘Cause you're not a black guy, you're a black eye.
Always looking for shock value. It's unlikely that you like me, pal.
Shock value, God literally wants to strike me now,
‘cause I catch bodies after bodies, you see, my life be foul.
That's why I'm taxing and getting checks to put a soul(sole) in a bag like Nike Town.
Hold on. Think about that, that shit's deep.
But what the fuck you gon' do, huh?
With your Mayweather promotions.. let the fifth leak, you pipsqueak? Bitch, please.
You’d probably sell out your fam and send them up shit's creek for chips, B.
Wow, this bitch blew(blue) and turncoat quicker than Mystique. Bitch, please.
It's deja vu to me; no ski mask when I'm steeling you,
that Shotgun in his face: look at me when I'm killing you.
Just be yourself, Corey; those are words from the industry.
They all knew you couldn't work for me lyrically.
You're autistic, so how you getting checks at home but can't work this(dis-) ability?
As for me, I write from what the fuck I see; my view from the pits.
If the tool come equipped and I'm sealing your top, that means I'm roofing your shit.
So quit fucking fronting, ‘cause you won't buck for nothing: you're frugal as shit.
And if I scope him off the top, it's just my View From The Six.
Now, he said my battles went in the vault; damn right, I was wild thirst.
For y'all to see the footage, my style hurts, pound dirt,
so I'ma put Corey in the ground Earth,
just so the fans get to catch the body, it's like we crowd surf.
And, one more thing. Bro, you have really fucking bad luck with national television.
No, like, like, really fucking bad luck.
I mean, first you went on B.E.T. and they ain't cast your ass.
Last week, Canada A.M., they banned your ass.
But it's because everybody hypes him. Somebody must've gassed that hater,
‘cause still your bars been half-assed, playa.
You just bringing the city down with faulty lines like San Andreas.
I got a new slogan, bitch. Fuck you fakes, corny, keep doing what y'all do,
and stay the fuck away from me. Brooklyn all day. I keep it trill for that.
Lick a shot for PH, ‘cause the real is back.
Yeah, I did rap for 80-year-olds on TV. It's a bad look? You want to talk about it?
Half of them have Alzheimer’s; they've already forgot about it.
But I've been battling for seven years, still cashing checks.
The fans still love me; still get mad respect.
I snap your neck; I still spaz with vets.
K-Shine's hat.. still ain't landed yet.
But did Shine leave a mark? Hell no.
If I slap him, you'll really see prints(Prince) on Cort’(court) like the Chappelle show.
Me and 'Ganik are boys; he knows I'm the truth.
He'll say his dog ate this ese(essay) like a homework excuse.
The internet hates; it's what they constantly spew.
This ain't the last supper, don't whine(wine) when I give this body to you.
I'll burn Ernesto to ash; that's what they want me to do.
Ernesto starts with an Ern(urn) and I'll make sure he ends off in one too.
In Atlanta, you said you're dead broke. How is he a G?
You borrowed $300 from Sonny, not for his kid he needs to feed,
it was so you could buy an outfit to look fly on B.E.T.
That's what you think about when you're getting your bread?
What about making sure your son is eventually fed?
I guess them Instagram likes are better instead.
I let the Shine get to my cheek; you let the shine get to your head.
How are you in your thirties and have no wealth?
How do you not feed your kid like he has no mouth?
And you say I'm not a man ‘cause I didn't scrap myself?
If I bought outfits instead of child support, I would slap myself.
Image, street cred - that's what you preach about.
When I have a son, work ethic, education - that's what I'll teach about.
My son will be at his graduation and thank me for reaching out,
while your son's on welfare like, "There's some shit we got to speak about.”
But yo, I was reviewing your little street code, let me get my facts right.
If someone slaps you, you supposed to hit them back right?
And if someone jumps your boy, on sight you get their back right?
Well, ain't this the first time you been around Dizaster since the Math fight?
I thought you'd be showing up ready to spaz in a ski mask
You should've put Dizaster underground like the Cassidy rematch
Right now, Math calling like, "You ain't got balls like that.
Dizaster right there. Why ain't you tap his jaw like that?
That's why Smack put you in the vault like that."
You apologize for being a hoe, Math hung up and you called right back.
You are clearly not a top tier, buddy.
Look at those teeth; you're doing top tier gummies.
There's a reason you're broke and don't have top tier money;
it’s ‘cause no one in the world thinks you're top tier, dummy.
So it don't matter if you think I'm a bottom tier cracker,
as long as I keep killing Smack's bottom tier rappers.
I put the beam on these self righteous niggas; fuck B Dot.
You'll think this nigga changed his name the way he'll see(C) dots.
Nah, fuck these gun bars; I ain't come here to spark this nigga.
When you in front of a false prophet, you supposed to talk to niggas.
Don't you run with Brother Polite, a ignorant nigga who promotes polygamy?
How you gon’ lead us when you a slave to another man's bigotry?
Peep the imagery: a fake nigga, posing as a damn leader,
versus Black Jesus, that could turn water to Sangria.
You don't want it with these bars. You don't want it with these hands either;
I’ll bet he break up after the first land like Pangea.
You come across as a social political activist,
but you just using rap to tap into niggas’ pockets likes Aktive is.
I ain't gon' lie, that shit you be talking sound good; you be preaching, Dot,
but I brainstormed under my mental umbrella. You be reaching, Dot.
You trying to force feed us your views on right and wrong through writing songs,
but in October, ReeCee went to the Million Man March, and you didn't ride along.
See, this first round, I'll counteract the key to your plan,
but by the third(,) I(eye)’ll put one in your Pineal gland.
You battled Fiji, Stricc, a freestyle Daylyt, now you facing D. Myers.
You finally stepped up to a plus(A+); now we'll see where B mind is(B-).
Your neck, that's just something for me to hack at.
For these Dead Presidents, I'll leave this preacher’s head in a backpack.
You want this crown of the west? Here, nigga, put on both of my shoes.
You ever been to New York, in front of a thousand niggas hoping you lose?
You ever defend this coast to the point you’d let a gat blast?
It’s funny how you talk all this slave shit, but I'm the one taking the backlash.
I got on a Dallas Stars hockey jacket, banana clip tucked. I'm 'bout to jugg his ass.
You'll see the crescent moon come from under the star like the Muslim flag.
I laid the Blueprint for the west, but he is an offender clearly.
This gun is the schematics to leave any nigga injured near(engineer) me.
You can't even trust the niggas that follow you;
that's what Jesus’ apostles proved.
I'm over top of you, Aristotle view;
the Choppa fuse his molecules with fossil fuels.
I'm confused; this not for views. Let's rationalize, B.
Anytime you writing(,) god, you supposed to capitalize(,) G.
Sonic Soundwaveus gave me game; he said, “nigga, fuck a metaphor.”
Now I'm in the hood, riding with a panther like Skeletor.
Charles Burnley, I ain't wanna get these guns involved,
but if I meet you at the Crossroads, your nephew’ll be missing his uncle Charles.
They crazy if they think I ain’t a legend;
they even use my age as reference.
This is facial recognition technology on a ancient weapon;
it'll give his chin a new identity like a Asian wedding.
I won't come at you with a mob of niggas; it'll be me, two or just three.
In case them cells see us(Celsius), you gotta keep a small circle, to a degree.
And even though he already on the ground with this shit,
this wack emcee got another two rounds of this shit.
Yikes!
Black, African power. But I see all skin folk ain’t your kinfolk,
and by the looks of things current, see, it’s all about currency;
these mental slaves want me to pay, but these chains on my brain been broke.
I came in this game for change. Look, Danny, I knew what I was in fo’
giving up this type info; I knew these lames’d want to tear down my frame,
but as long as they saw that picture, that’s really all I was pic(k)ed fo’.
Now these rounds is a breath of fresh air like Mentos;
after me, there’ll be no others to do what I did, though.
I broke bread with sinners, had dinners where men toast,
brag, boast about whose toast shot men most.
I said fuck all that jargon; I’m not here to trade bars and bargain
with politicians just to win votes.
This arc of this new covenant; it been dope from the get-go,
but the BarGod gon’ try to flood us with stories. All mythos.
Well tell him I’m Christlike,
meaning I walk right(write) on water: everything come out that pen floats.
I been dope, before my battle with Fiji or Stricc, bro.
My people see me as a reincarnation of the Pharaoh Ahmose,
running out this hyksos,
and I know you niggas don’t read the glyphs, though,
but I went back, did the research, delved in feet first,
read script slow, then brought y’all the Cliff notes.
Planting seeds in y’all mind, even if you don’t find what I spit dope,
that’s fine; I sense the shit,
so it’s photosynthesis how son(sun) shine and we get growth.
Look what I get, though.
All this hate. But wait(weight); heavy is the crown when you trying to uplift, though.
It’s obvious, I got to go against my opposites
in order to diametrically complement my wit, bro,
so this is god in the flesh versus this demigod with little to no theological info.
I mean, the brother that don’t fuck around versus the well-known nympho.
I’m intellectual; you electrical. Well, let’s not compare the type.
Yeah, we both fire, but Myers,
it’s different degrees, and we don’t seem to fare in height(Fahrenheit).
Let’s be clear tonight. For starts, it’s nothing I’m ruling out.
Nigga, I don’t give a fuck nor care; I’ll line a(North Carolina) nigga up.
It’s March; it’s only right that we Duke it out.
Now, they gon’ hoot and shout as you jump around this stage and move about,
but please don’t talk about guns;
you got too many daughters and sons to pulling out.
We can shoot it out.
You know, take ten steps and draw; I’m illustrating how we can duel it out.
I’m a landlord with the pistol. I’m evicting this bullets; they moving out.
And for the record, I’m well-versed, and got hooks; Kareem Abdul your mouth.
You talking sweet, I’m digging deep to get to the bottom of it, pulling that root canal(ruger now).
I’m what the truth is, pal.
I emerged out of the waters like a evolutionary amphibian,
climbing the ladder of battle rap,
and cognitive dissonance has got the comp dissing him.
All 'cuz I washed Fiji, went strict on Stricc,
then got Lyt(light) out of nowhere: Aunt Vivian.
I’m positioning myself to be amongst the elites with the sentences;
I got knowledge, wordplay, punches, angles..
Like, I’m too deep; you can’t compete with this Kemet shit.
I been peeped you as feminine.
I was just waiting, and Boom, you started Surfing
another nigga wave, trying to speak on his penmanship.
Making allegations, then had to retract your statements when
you couldn’t make it legitimate. How ridiculous.
You in these battle rap groups, sharing private information for validation,
dry snitching, blowing up a mean spot.
All these gun bars, huh? You shooting this and shooting that;
nigga, the only thing you would snap was a screenshot.
We done figured you out, Danny, but we figured you’d figure this out too.
You know you be investigating; I’m sure you know me, nigga.
But you remind me of my favorite gun:
always trying to snub somebody, you nosy nigga.
I bet you wish you could summon O.D., nigga.
So he could stand right here and yell “time” in the middle of my rhymes
so I don’t OD, nigga,
but this ain’t AHAT. These the Battlegroundz, where I play at.
You chase the East, they charge you fees,
and you’ve already shown that you pay that.
Did you really believe you’d get that 12k back?
My nigga, if it was all WWE, you wouldn’t say that.
We know you not Macho. Man,
you wasn’t gon’ run up on Randy like a Savage and spray that.
You can save that, ‘cause on the up and up,
how you expect brothers on the Under to take that?
Like you was gon’ leave him Stone Cold, laid flat.
He’ll need a coffin, a coroner.
You got nothing in your Arse(o)nal. You’re out of your league;
all these theatrics outside of the ring and you’re still not the Ultimate Warrior.
Pardon if I’m boring ya.
What, y’all tired of hearing about how he gave them k’s to Rex?
But he supposed to be from the West and paid them checks.
Look, I know we talk about it religiously;
I just figured he muslim the way he kneel to the East to pay respects.
But it’s on to the next shit on your checklist.
“New York is biased.” Why? ‘Cause NuNu called time?
You wasn’t spitting your best shit.
Don’t front and cover up that fact; I’m getting a Vibe,
magazines for everyone who subscribe to that East vers’ West shit.
I’m like a mad scientist with that tech grip; I’ll murk this cat.
Neil DeGrasse Tyson when I work the strap.
I’ll bomb on his bitch. Tell B.O.B. that’s the only time we’ll see a Earth that’s flat.
It could be you and six of your brethren; I’ll drive through, work the weapon.
You squares could run(Koran), but it’ll be more ish(Moorish) if I have to Circle Seven.
You’ll get Smacked mentioning my name with a P.G. reference.
I’m Proving going over and around them Grounds
is the only time you’ll find me P.G. stepping.
I keep it Western. Went on the War Report, then I was supposed to report for war.
They had all these niggas I never heard before,
local N.Y. P.G.s calling up from the corner store.
“Yo, Son, when you gon’ get on Smack? When you gon’ get on Smack?”
I say, when one of them vets want to collide with the rookie.
I was close to the edge feeling like all these heads was trying to push me,
so I’ll go to New York, not to battle, but to let it rattle
on one of them snakes on that line like, “try me, pussy.”
I’d shoot up that whole P.G. class like I was tired of bullies,
and after that, Smack wouldn’t provide me fully.
It’d be just like this lame’s name. Well, let me explain.
After that homicide, the D.A. in(N) N.Y. ‘d be the only guy trying to book me.
Got him.
I'm standing over my own dead body, while onlookers have stale faces,
the streetlights above reflecting light off the shell cases.
I don't know what quite happened; the site’s madness,
ambulances, sirens, lights flashing while my life passing.
My spirit outside my body, leaving for the journey,
two police officers hold my wife back while she reaching for the gurney.
A black man had run up on me and popped the nine off.
In the midst of all this chaos, B Dot watches from a sidewalk.
He's wrecked with guilt, his conscience heavy; he's grief-stricken.
He's feeling responsible that I'd become a street victim,
because he knows it was he who said, "follow me I say; this lead I take.”
He got the key, but this combination lets him know even he not safe.
See what I did there? It took the death of me to ascend destiny.
Mindframe of a Dick Gregory in the mid-70's,
so how is it fair a con(Farrakhan) can then step to me?
But his tears resurrected me; it's mysterious, G.
My mind is not from this star system; I'm serious, B(Sirius B).
Bullets are intended for us, or we die when a stray hit us.
That's why I keep my biscuit with me at all times like Dre Vishiss.
I had a homeboy who was red flagging. He banged his hood; he had a bad rep.
I had to witness Blood sacrifice soon as they gave his ass tech(Aztec).
These streets are cold. Look at the brand of pain we at.
How ironic, how they put together Dot and a maniac(Animaniac).
My brain react, ‘cause he trying to put a end to Danny.
I'll hit niggas not even related to you with that extended(,) family.
Your bitch is trampy, but she could ride a dick; homie, ya ho is wild.
She keeps her balance on the wood like Eddie Murphy in Golden Child.
Oh, you gon' label me a drug dealer, 'cause I done served a lil PCP?
Oh, I done put more poison in our community then BBD?
Well, what you didn't see is when I bought that little kid a PS4
‘cause for a dub rock, his mama sold his PS3.
See, I regret some of the shit I done did homie,
like buying food stamps from that smoker, then feeling guilty 'cause her kids hungry.
Yes, I recognize god gave me a talent, respect,
but I was learning about life's checks and balances before I could balance a check.
I already know where I'm headed; that road is just grim.
You can't put fear in a man whose soul is condemned.
See, I sought a job, but I was taught survive against all the odds.
See, the BarGod got these bars from god, but I'm barred from God.
I used to stomp niggas out; that was the best way I punished.
Now I prefer the strap over the kicks like XJ-900’s.
Pay( )less attention. He cold as ice; I’ma unthaw y’all glacier.
I'm the anti-hero to the man y’all call y’all savior.
These bars will leave you crippled;
now I must know, what college you got this knowledge from, Charles, Xavier?
Don't mind me. The shit I be on is beyond whatever B on.
Even if he cold off the top, I’m the wrong nigga to free on(freon).
You gotta be conditioned to stay off the ground with this shit;
this wack emcee got a whole ‘nother round of this shit.
Yikes!
See, this that shit that be igging me.
When these punchline rappers want to get “conscious” ‘cause they dissing me.
I find it interesting.
So in your last battles, you only let your gat rattle
in order to fit in with battle rap’s imagery?
Or you taking the high road? But before, it was the low with no dignity.
That’s like shopping for shoes too small to use:
you just took your soul(sole) out in order to fit in, literally.
So look, this what y’all get to see.
A Black Panther convict versus a backpacking hobbit with illiterate nonsense.
All of a sudden Danny Myers want to kick knowledge.
Nigga, you not even a little bit conscious.
You thirty-six, still talking about blowing up.
False flag: we can’t even consider you a legitimate bomb threat.
That whole scheme you just did was all an interesting concept.
Meanwhile, I got the intellect of Jay Elec’, meshed with an intricate Nas depth.
I’m Illmatic in battle rap fashion, fastened together by that same thread
that attaches badges of honor to the sleeve on a fatigue jacket of a Vietnam vet.
Your knowledge is no contest.
What you know about the Anu’, ahkhee?
I’m talking deep research; don’t state the norm.
I’ll have Madji shoot arrows in a blazing storm.
You’ve been warned. Kemet is who they adored,
but you like to learn from some aryan(Sumerian),
so I give my boys the cue and they ‘ll form (Cuneiform).
Swinging swords? Nah, it’s more like knowledge in the clips when I shoot at you.
Toasters in a holster; I’ll have these rounds swinging off the hip like a hula hoop.
Pop at your medulla, too. Your whole team better scurry on.
Nigga, my pops was a shooter too. It’s my genes for me to carry(Curry) on.
I come through walking dead like Mr. Wavy
with that shotty on or have that nine probably.
I’ll shoot your arm, leg, leg, arm, head, and get this god bodied,
but nah, he, me immortal. If we Kombat, I’m diminishing dude;
sock him. Knock him out where he stand,
have him swinging his head like he waiting on a finishing move.
Listen, it ain’t all about dissing the dude.
I mean, Danny, you cold, B(Kobe).
You put on for L.A.; I’m glad that a few got to witness it.
Oh, you retiring?
We wish you best, but the truth is the West need new representatives,
‘cause you, Diz, Day, the triple D’s, all keeping a(-)breast in your respective position,
but y’all make the West look suspicious,
and you from Writer’s Bloque? Nigga, I’m from a rider’s block;
maybe that’s why we addressing shit different.
I’m just stressing our difference ‘cause here we have a nigga from the hood
that said he not from no hood,
you know, straight out of South Central, a nerd with an attitude,
another O’Shea Jackson, duke. Nah, this can’t be no battle dude.
You all in your battle raps gripping the snub
or fetching it with your pistol, giving that four-fifth a hug,
but never once have I heard you utter a word on whether you Crip or you Blood;
nigga, what set is you from?
And don’t play me dumb, nigga, you know how this done.
I need the head up or your head up get boxed in if you tell me, “it’s none.”
Nigga, what set is you from?
I’m not glorifying gangbanging for one,
but in South Central, we all know the mental of niggas with shit that got to get done.
They put in work, may go to jail, and well, that’s another brother neglecting his son,
and mother can’t protect for the young,
so he get put on a set; that come with a rep and a gun.
You know he got to be a real nigga, not a replica one. So they hit him with a funds,
a little real work to get off; he can help with the mortgage.
Besides, them guys from the other side might ride
and want to give him more triggers. Funerals get expensive. Mama couldn’t afford it;
she just got and supported
her baby boy dialed into the streets and she can’t even call it.
Now, this is that regular ghetto family portrait.
You understand why this vision is kind of important?
It’s uncanny; we should see all this in Danny,
but the picture you painting is kind of distorted.
But you the “BarGod”, so you figuring niggas’d probably ignore it.
The “top dog” on the West can shuffle the deck; you pull his card, it’s,
“Aw, I was that Good Kid in that MA.A.D City,” trying to Kendrick Lamar it,
well that’s when we run up on your van with them cans
and do you like a Kendrick Lamar skit,
let that damn Llama spray.
Oh, you here for Sherane, Danny? We need to know where your grandmama stay.
Get out the car ‘fore I snatch you out that motherfucker. Andale.
The forty clap, it’ll roll him back like a yoga mat. Namaste. Let’s be honest. Hey.
Uncle Red said, you should leave the streets alone. Go ‘head and battle rap.
Yet every time you battle rap, you tattle-tat
‘bout how you handle packs and blast your past; imagine that.
The only reason we knew your talent is ‘cause you got detached from that.
Now you use your talents to glorify drugs and violence;
well that’s that same exact habitat.
And what do y’all extract from that? Perhaps it’s that
little Daniel was never found where the action at.
You wanted to swim with the sharks, but couldn’t play the part.
You had to Go(,) Fish, you couldn’t match with that.
Now you’s an acrobat trying to flip all these lines and shit
‘bout how you supply the bricks and light up the street like a Gaza Strip
but you never shared blood with the Bloods or C-walked in stride with Crips?
You lying prick. Either you got put off the set ‘cause you wouldn’t die for shit,
or you was never out, always in the house on the couch, eating pie with Clips.
Which side is it? I mean, you designed this shit, so you aught to decide the shit.
You claim we got the same ideologies,
but I could tell by your rhyming schemes which god you with,
‘cause you provide the script, claim it was inspired on divine and shit,
but that’s ambiguous language for your disciples that have to decipher wit.
Well, good thing I’m involved with enlightenment. Ain’t no mental enslaving him?
See, you a personification of religion. You know,
gods always behaving like the people that created them. This explains it then.
This deity of yourself you created is made up in the image which relates to him.
Just like the authors of the bible, you went around writing about
your surroundings and different cultures you was engaging in.
“Well, B Dot always mentioning the bible. What you saying then?”
I’m saying, keep your eyes open. All trey of them.
We can’t just believe in a god because he hides behind an amazing pen.
What the fuck could you say to win?
You want to know what's killing black men?
It's not the system, racism, gang violence, and all this black on black.
Take a look closer, it's this very culture we call Battle Rap.
This the one place we entertain talking 'bout clapping gats.
I can disrespect your black mother, and black women, and they all gon' laugh at that.
I could ask them for twenty dollars apiece, to build a business within our habitat,
and they all gon' scoff at me, like "nigga, I could get a sack with that.”
Your whole angle is elevating the black concience, yet you participate in this nonsense.
Is this your way of infiltrating our ignorant minds so we can make progress?
Stop it. I don't feel your skill is threat.
I'll give Creflo Dollar 65 from the mill’, then jet.
How the fuck did you think you could outflow me?
My verbal ninjutsu is not a game; this is something you shou’ know, B(Shinobi).
Low key, since '03, I moved weight a couple of ways.
It's like the scale is embedded in me; I call it "stuck in my ways(weighs).
My fellow African, before Smack came to L.A. I was trafficking,
but at the same time, I can tell you what's buried under the Vatican.
I beat niggas to a pulp(pope), no fiction(Pulp Fiction) within my diction.
I'll send you to the merciful
with a pair of scopes(periscope) like a submersible.
God level. Don't let that be a deterrent.
Even though that was a submarine bar, my flow is above the current.
Nigga, I still keep my hammer raised,
‘cause I ain't seen Justice since that nigga got his head blown on Janet braids.
How Poetic, B Dot got all these bars and he still suck.
You can't break down a man that deconstruct your build ups.
I talk real stuff with five percenters, Muslims, Christians.. this is what the game be.
Religion is just a bunch of different branches that lead to the same tree.
But it pains me you scrutinize niggas who bang they lamas.
You talk all this political shit like your last name Obama.
Well remember that kid I sent to the store?
That's symbolic of you, ‘cause niggas never bring us the change they promised.
Nigga, how could I not be mean?
I'm from a different Creed; that's why I should beat your ass to the Rocky theme.
We need to be getting ready for Marshall Law, for the revolution. They gon' fuck with us,
but soon as we try to rise, well(Roswell), get ready for the military(;) cover up.
I left bodies in that debris field, nigga. I'm past nice.
You dealing with a man who possess unseen rounds that can crash sites.
But fuck the grey area; sometimes we got to direct the shots.
In order for my strap to complete the entire picture, it must connect to Dot.
I promise, the type of beef we in gon’ get the morgue’s attention.
What happens after I get his length, width, and height is only for the four to mention(4th dimension).
You bring those brothers to gas you, and to help the crowd decide;
they're instrumental to your lyrics, that's why they're on B side.
For the record, you ain't met no niggas ill as me.
You ain't gotta be associated with the Wu Tang Clan to see a Killa(,) B.
The steel'll be tucked, wrong nigga to go to war with.
I'll expose his chest behind the magazine, like Halle Berry in Swordfish.
The four spit and split him. He on the ground with this shit;
Thank the lord he don't got another round of this shit.
Yikes!
Peace to my sisters that be watching my battles. They figure me consciously gifted,
plus I’m handsome, so you know they showing the man some interest.
I love all my queens, but I wear this ring every battle;
please don’t act like you missed it.
See, I won’t do like this dipshit. You know, pursue you for sex, so persistent?
Make you a jump off or a mistress,
create a little life, now make you my wife,
and when you ask about marriage, dismiss it?
Nah. I inherit these merits from the ancestors; I’m different.
I’m bringing back the black family structure
of when it was apparent that parents uplifted.
I ain’t preaching no scriptures.
Look, Danny, I’m far from perfect; I can’t even speak to the distance.
I’m just a work in progress, trying to reach my pinnacle,
and for battle rap, I got minimal interest,
but this is a topic at hand that needs to have the top twist off of the can.
I’m reaching in, exposing your flaws; you my dog and all,
but boy, I’m ‘bout to make you a man. It’s some shit I don’t think you understand.
Maybe I’m the brother that can bring it to life.
I mean, I expose the darkness in niggas.
I did it with Fiji, Stricc, and we all say how I brought it to Lyt(light).
It’s not about who’s wrong or who’s right. I mean, we sort of alike,
both glued to the tube, watching that Family Feud,
but you amused; I’m more confused, like, “who ordered this fight?”
Mommy submissive, Daddy dismissive, staying out on that corner all night.
Daddy the head of the household, but Mommy got to keep her mouth closed;
she give an opinion, it might result in a right.
But tonight, I’m restoring your plight,
‘cause that European religion got you niggas caught in the hype.
They gave you book of stories about men of glory, and you bought the shit, right?
Well why is there no female deity supporting your Christ?
You know, “the father, son, holy spirit”?
You may not hear, but your daughters just might.
Aw, nigga, we gon go there tonight.
I’m not one to judge, but where was the gloves? Nowhere in sight?
Ten kids, all these baby mommas? Come on, Danny Myers, you know that ain’t right.
But I noticed your type. You’s a fiend. You paid to get on Smack,
so it all makes sense how you can’t keep control of your pipes,
but these are the days of our lives. It all ties into religion and the way it’s contrived.
You treat the black woman like a side bitch,
well, ’cause, you was taught she came from your side,
and my nigga, that’s all right. That’s why we got to debate the contention.
I’m certain I’m the right surgeon to make this incision;
I’m splitting the part of your brain that has that Eurocentric dimension.
They Willie Lynched him, really convinced him that the black woman is bitch and
see, that white man is historically wicked,
but if you’re morally gifted, that’s when the story gets shifted.
They got you plugged into the Matrix; it’s basic, but you’re ignoring your glitches.
Like, in the beginning, was the word, and the word was God.
That’s how it go in the scriptures,
but when them agents roll in to get you,
you got to do like Neo and go see your Oracle, and oh, now you know she a sister.
See how the white man just did ya?
He hid god in plain sight, ‘cause he knew you would ignore the enigma.
He can steal frames from your brain, ‘cause he know
you ain’t gon’ pause and analyze the still frames as he motions the picture.
My nigga, I been chosen to get ya.
The black woman is god, Danny. I’m hear to breathe life into that dead message,
‘cause you’s a fuckboy that just likes to fuck, boy;
you went around making bed messes.
Find women you like, you rock, then roll them out: Led Zeppelin.
You damage the box, knock it up, and don’t care about the deliveries;
no wonder why you got fed ex(FedEx)es.
I got to stress this, ‘cause you missed the lessons taught by ancestors.
We put our women on the throne.
That’s the definition for the name; it explains who our set is.
I hope y’all catch this. They created a Adam and Eve to make y’all believe
that a woman was to blame for why we’re deceived. The fuck y’all feeling that for?
I can’t fathom an Adam when every picture I’ve seen, he’s depicted to be
with a belly button, so did he have an um-biblical cord?
Did he come from the womb or not? Don’t ask what I’m getting biblical for.
It’s all suitable; it ties into the root of you
and explains why you treat women like whores.
See, Danny, you exactly the nigga I figured you for.
Just another battle rap nigga that want to get in this ring and spit about war.
But won’t teach your children about stacking and building,
group economics, or how to be an entrepreneur.
As far as battle rap, aw, nigga, you got it for sure,
but here’s the question. Are you selling a product, or are you just a product in store?
See, these are topics that we got to explore.
You say you love this culture; that type of shit don’t even matter no more.
You got all these battles galore.
You thirty-six, still not running your own league; these the things I’m mad at you for.
Perhaps we should travel some more,
back to the past when blacks was treated like cattle; absorb
how the slavemaster wanted us to fuck and breed
so he could push our seeds through that revolving door.
You a 2016 version of that. (Clapping) Encore.
Keeping up with the dumb shit. I ain’t even trying to uplift.
I’m just trying to differentiate,
so these queens know who to gate and who not to fuck with,
before they get stuck with a nigga like you that’ll load their boat, then jump ship.
Never heard you once spit ‘bout your kids, how you hold them close,
but you’ll brag and boast about that pump grip; nigga, that’s punk shit.
How we gon’ raise up these daughters if we not praising their mommas?
Nigga, the black family going through genocide,
and Danny, all bullshit aside, you engaged in that slaughter.
You just a big fucking kid; the way you behave, I’m amazed you’re a father,
but the universe creates and it authors,
and that last page gon’ have your daughters
introducing Danny to a brand new daddy, and you can’t escape from that karma.
We won’t debate any longer. As far as battle rap, I’m done with that,
unless I have a Revelation.
Tell Th3 Saga that’d be the only situation where god is coming back.
I know you all wanted Carter versus Head I.C.E.; trust me, I see the appeal,
street guy against a guy from a completely different field.
You wanted gangster versus nerd; well, tell me how you feel.
You got gangster versus gangster, it's about to get real.
When I took this battle, they told me to keep it light; just jokes, don't kill the hype.
Then I guess I'm the villain, right? Brought a knife to a pillow fight.
You wanted I.C.E.? That's nice; I’m I.C.E. of all different types.
Ice Cube, Ice-T… Okay, mostly Vanilla Ice.
Either way, Carter Deems, you are a strangle little fellow,
probably pronounce milk like "malk" and pillow like "pellow”.
But he's not the type of person that at first you would assume,
I'm more afraid of Carter Deems than any person in this room,
‘cause he's just way too nice. Like creepy, freak type of nice.
Like smiling while he murders you in your sleep type of nice.
But nah, he's not a mad man, he's a cat man;
he'll end up with a cat(-)woman like Batman.
His screensaver is a cat doing jazz hands,
and he gets way too hyped up over CAT scans.
He likes munching on his chap stick, cuddling with fat chicks,
huffing on some catnip and suckling on cat nips.
But after all that mean stuff I just said, I guess you do deserve a hug.
[hug snub]
Not from me, Carter Deems, I meant from somebody you love.
You look and smell like you've been rolling in the mud,
and to be honest, I wouldn't touch you with a pair of rubber gloves.
(I’m sorry. I’m just joking.)
You don't think Carter a straight G? Well I'll fart on your lady,
eat your poutine then barf up the gravy on your carpet and drapery.
See that's how the old Carter would say schemes,
but my life has been harder here lately, so I can't promise that my bars will be crazy,
but I had five seizures last year, so it's okay if I start a little shaky.
His rhythm is weak plus you look a little beat; you got the heart of a baby.
I'm sick(,) dog, pardon the rabies. Yesterday I ate part of a pastry,
from an artisan bakery; it was large and amazing.
It wasn't hard, it was flaky, and every part of it's tasty.
You can catch me parking an H3,
‘cause I work as a valet parking cars, ‘cause they pay me.
Even when it's dark and it's rainy,
you can catch me in between those white lines like I'm sniffing hard in the eighties.
Atlanta pro, so I'm armed with the Bravery.
He'll lie buried(library’d); I should charge you a late fee.
Yeah my squad's small. Still we ball out; I started on J.V.
This match up more brutal than football between Army and Navy.
My cannon's so big, it's like I'm arming the Navy.
A mad dude with a credit card: I charge when I'm angry.
Talk like a gentleman, but test the kid again,
you'll hear sir cuss(circus) like Barnum and Bailey.

Photo by Zach Macphoto for KOTD.Overdose on potent schemes, flowing through my brain like dopamine.
I'm dope, I mean, catch me in a V12 rolling clean.
Don't believe me? You can search engine, like you opened Bing.
Make that Cobra sing like yodeling; hit you with a Force that’d make Yoda lean.
Hand me a Razor and I'll flip out, like when my Motorola ring.
Catch me rolling on a roller rink.
As a kid, I gained some weight, too many cookies, too much Ovaltine;
in high school I was a bit rounder. I was an oval teen.
Catch me at a Hot Topic opening on the local scene,
girls crushing my hopes and dreams;
now battle rap’s like prom all over again, ‘cause nobody want to go with Deems.
Still, people are mad that I had this offer.
Well, I'll even battle the battle bloggers
to prove I run these streets like an avid jogger,
then use my hands like I'm bad at soccer.
Grab the choppers, start blasting monsters
like Rick Grimes when he attacks a walker;
this dude will hit a grandpa in the face, then attack his walker.
You're not as nerdy as me; you're not even half as awkward.
I wear weirdness on my sleeve like a badge of honor.
Still I'll leave a bump on his face so big you should go see your acne doctor,
‘cause when I hit you in the face with these cat massagers,
I'll leave this slacker folded up like a pair of my khaki Dockers.
You look like, you would smell like, Doritos and mildew.
At first I thought you may have had a disability.. and I still do.
Sit back and watch me work Carter; I'm 'bout to work Carter.
Work harder, ‘cause I'm everything you never were, Carter.
And if you take it to the ping pong court, get wrecked at the rec center.
Press records; I'm a one-man band like Trent Reznor.
Better your best effort, yes, with less effort, less pressure,
head severed for trying to check Chedda.
The best seller, best ever. Doesn't get better; my pen's better,
trendsetter against a bed wetter, (I mean…)
Look, when I call you a bed wetter, that's a factual statement;
I've seen the pee-stained mattress that you have in the basement.
You wear a pair of Pull Ups when you pull up at your grandma's house,
sheets covered in plastic like your grandma's couch.

Man, you getting bodied by nothing but pee jokes;
you probably eat pea soup while wearing a peacoat.
Got URL fans saying, "Where the gun bars at?"
Me and Carter got it covered, bringing gun bars back.
The streets talk; got to keep watch. Eavesdrop from the tree tops.
Three shots, bring your Reeboks, ‘cause I keep Glocks in my knee socks.
Cheap talk in the T Dot gets you outlined in police chalk,
(Ppp, ppp, chikka, ppp, ppp)
like a white guy trying to beat box.
Catch you on a Friday, see me sitting sideways
’til I pull out out of nowhere like a hidden driveway.
(Bow. Just Joking.)
When I start bucking that, I put him in a box with no bubble wrap
after I show these long Tec’s(texts) like Rev Run in a bubble bath.
Okay, that's not true at all, but here are some other facts.
You paid for this battle and that’s something you can't rebuttal back,
‘cause I know exactly how much it cost you, and I paid double that.
I didn't even want to do this, but I was bored this weekend; thought I might as well.
I don't care about this battle at all; I just wanted to spend 500 on a flight and hotel.
You watch The Bachelor,
but last week he was busy, didn't have any time and missed it.
You thought I'd be a nice guy, forget it,
‘cause I'm about to give you so many spoilers you'd think I drive a Civic.
Like for instance: Ben took Jen on a date, but he still saw Liz on his nightly visit.
He brought a bottle of wine and sipped it,
which later caused Liz to get into a fight with Bridget,
just to be quite specific,
and you can stand there and act like you don't care,
but that just ruined your night, admit it.
I'm terrific. I can bring hard bars to prove that I can spit it, but my style has shifted,
and I really get too silly, I admit it, but even this guy can get it,
‘cause when I spit that silly heat, he'll see that the sky's the limit.
‘Cause that's when I'm in my bag,
like I'm sneaking on a plane without buying a ticket.
Temple tap. I invented that.

Photo by Christian Andrabado for BattleRap.com.I got a turquoise ring on my pinkie toe, believe me, bro.
I stay fresh to death 'til I'm six feet below.
I fought the Double Dragons, went three-and-oh. That's on a need-to-know.
Yeah, you can rap but do you need to? No.
Every time you see me go, I spazz out. You can't shake Deemsy flow,
even though I started having Little seizures(Caesar’s)
and I'm not talking pizza dough.
Strobe light...that's what I don't like.
It makes my spine ache, my eyes start to dilate,
a migraine, mind race to the middle of my mind state,
I get wobbly like I'm walking on ice skates, everything starts to go sideways,
Ah— I think I might be having one right now, I can feel my thighs shake..
Oh, never mind, I just had my phone on vibrate. I’m great.
I'll sneak in without tripping the wire,
while this dude gets caught like lint in the drier.
I'm someone you should really admire,
so don't get it twisted like you gripping the pliers.
I know we don't carry the tool, but I raise that heat when I'm spitting the fire,
so this dude will see defeat(Duff eat) like he's having dinner with Lizzie McGuire.
I don't care about this match up, so I raise the heat like I'm holding a match up.
This doesn't stack up. So confident, I'll put a stack up.
So we know you try to act tough, say you hit as hard as a Mack truck,
while I know you don't have a fast punch,
so I won't fall for your hands. That's a bad bluff.
I’ll hit him with a fart so hard it'll make him back up. You should call for backup.
Last week I helped my cousin move his couch; that's how I messed my back up,
so I can barely hold my back up.
I’ll hit him with a mean mug; that's a bad cup,
and I admit it, Bishop, I'm the one who keeps putting your mirror back up.
That was really weird. This is my impression of you:
"When arms get raised, that's where my B.O. sits.
I've got five friends with B.O. who all think that B.O.'s sick.
We nicknamed ourselves ‘The B.O. Six’ and came to BO6ix.
How many of us came to T.O. with B.O.? Six."
Man, I feel like I'm watching Pee Wee's Big Adventure in bad 3D,
if he was raised by Stewart from Mad TV,
mixed with a bit of Brick and a little bit Mister Bean.
You're not original at all, biggest phony to hit the scene,
‘cause you stole your whole persona and style from Krispy Kreme.
(Some people know who that is, but you know..)
And you literally had an epileptic fit you were so afraid of I.C.E.,
had you shaking on the sidewalk like a game of dice.
You wanted epilepsy jokes? Another One like DJ Khaled:
He's an epileptic vegan, favorite food is seizure(Caesar) salad.
So quit with the talking. You look like Christopher Robin
stuck in mid-transformation into Christopher Walken.
And Chris Robin can get walking. Just stop it and quit blogging.
In his town, he's a big problem. Big date? He'll be pill dropping,
slick talking and lip locking, just not when the chick's watching.
The Bill Cosby of Milwaukee. The Rick Ross of Wisconsin.
See, they hype you up now cause they're following a trend,
but look at Vince with the Raptors and what they thought about it then.
They see me put you on a map, but you'll fall of in the end,
and we can all watch Carter let Toronto down again.
I'm finished with the gimmick; sorry if you want me to rap about cats.
Matter of fact, cats are cool, but that was a fad
that I put on as a mask before each battle and match.
I mean, I give my pets a pat on the back,
but my cat was just a substitute I used cause I'm not blasting the gat.
It was a passive attack,
‘cause I don't shoot tec's or use meth or do sex, so I don't rap about that.
But don't worry, ‘cause I'm battling back,
so you can get him a soda and pass me a snack,
‘cause I already ate through Cheese just to prove that I mastered the craft(Kraft).
I'm not grabbing the macs; on the weekend I watch Breaking Bad and relax
until I'm having a nap. These are actual facts,
and on the weekdays I'm in my office, reading an actual fax.
Still, nobody's flowing with me.
I'll break into the championship bout, take 'em both out 'til I'm holding the keys,
beat those phony MC's and let 'Ganik put the chain over my tee like rosary beads.
I'll beat Grandma's Favorite Grandson with ease,
then eat a plate of macaroni and cheese,
so by the end of the night I've beaten Illmac', uh, Roney and Cheese.
But in real life this guy is scary. He'll make that big thing sing like Mariah Carey
that’ll put me in a House of pain(Payne) like Tyler Perry.
After this my life is buried, and not even playing with fire prepared me,
‘cause when he starts cooking, he'll put those flames on my shirt like Guy Fieri.
When he steps out, the gats are ready.
He'll light me up even though the mac is heavy,
so gangster, he’ll probably pop my collar cause I'm acting preppy.
All about the cash and fetti, fast and furious 'til he crash the Chevy,
he'll grab the blam and go H.A.M. while I'm at the deli, just ‘cause I asked for veggies.
When this dude's gripping the biscuit, he's not asking you to pass the jelly,
‘cause every time he eats, he takes it to the Max like Zack and Kelly.
Born to be a sharpshooter, it's in his DNA to blast machetes,
and a gun fight is Thug Life, he'll rat-a-tat my belly like Makaveli.
But I'm not on a crusade against those who rap about guns,
it's just there's a million other things to rap about that I've actually done.
I rap about microwaves,
‘cause when I used the stove, I burned the back of my thumb.
I spit about minivans, ‘cause that's what my parents been driving since back in ’91.
We had a dent on the bumper, had an accident, son.
Stain on the seat, I had an accident, son.
And this is real life, so I don't care if you're asking, "Who won?"
after it's done, ‘cause my life is an average one.
I just like to get people laughing with puns.
I don't do this to make fun of battling; I do this cause battling’s fun.
So with that being said, I’ll pull up to a Hobby Lobby in a drop top Maserati
same color as a pot of coffee if that pot of coffee was the same color as hot wasabi.
I'll take my shirt off; I’ll flash for the cash like the paparazzi.
Live life like a kamikaze;
Carter's so savage, you better keep a chain on this animal like a Tamagotchi.
That's time, you got me?
Right away. I came all the way from L.A. to this show to fight,
and don't trip, I'm not about to let you down like Quill did with a choke tonight.
You already got bodied by Diz,
so after tonight, this’ll be your second time dying in a row.
They'll be saying you won(one) zero back to back like binary code.
I do freestyles, multi's, punches, wordplay;
you just do bar after bar, and you're known to reach some
while I(eye) contact from every angle like the Mona Lisa.
Pussy, I really rap,
so he's fucking dead(,) people,
‘cause I'm coming(summing) for a cold body like necrophiliacs.
And he'll react like,
"I'm a cannibal; I don't just kill, I feed of it, but only if the rules are fine.”
Well since he's a cannibal,
I'll make him eat his backbone, and watch as he chews the spine.
Don't believe it? Boy, fuck with me;
these hands left more kids split than joint custody.
Joints rupturing when your cranium straight splatters;
occipital lobe over there, frontal lobe over there, now let's see if his brain matter,
‘cause King Of The Dot let a killer loose like the OJ Simpson case panel
to put a middle eastern in a bag, behind bars, like a Guantanamo Bay scandal.
Get your face scrambled with hands thrown at a ferocious speed,
but he doesn't need to be an R&B fan for Gjo to see(Jodeci)
that I'ma okay seeing Gjo-Gjo(KC & JoJo) catch a hook on a slower beat.
You scrapping is something we just don't believe.
"But Christ the second coming if you rise—“ Shut up!
What I could do with one blade
will remind you of a confession booth from his whole appearance,
‘cause he'll be spilling his guts after I come clean across(a cross)
and I'll be leaving a(believe in a) holy spirit.
The hole will spill and tear his cavity;
doctors will have to support the core(Corps) like military families.
I’d bury all(burial) your cast; get(casket) dropped
‘cause you wouldn’t(wooden) box. This is your funeral now.
No, pay attention. I said "burial", "casket" "wooden box", this is your funeral now;
did you catch the plot?
[walks around snapping fingers]
Woah, woah, woah, y'all thought I was slipping? Man, just stop.
That wasn't a choke;
I just figured he needed a moment of silence before the casket dropped.
But if he survives, I’ll put the piece up right at his teeth and I’ll just
keep on firing 'til he eats the magazine: Reader’s Digest,
or bleed when I send one swing to just finish then leave you stiff and
sleeping with your teeth next to you like senior citizens,
or leave him splitted with one punch in the head to come and just shred or
crush in his septum when it bust in the center,
fucking up your whole appearance like a public defender.
You love to pretend these writtens you've given a futuristic image to,
like this is new, is misconstrued,
‘cause the simple truth’s you're living through an artificial formula like infants do.
While the rest of us were taking a match
any date that we can and breaking our backs,
Smack gave you a way to get past,
so now you're like Moses, the way your power came from a snake and the staff.
That bridge is how he's risen, but now he wouldn't be shit without these,
so it's safe to say The Dude wouldn't be the same without Bridges
like the Big Lebowski.
You use religious references to get cheap reaction
off their applicability to the general public,
then set them up with collective subjects but wedge in one hit direct enough that
when you end with punches, the perception of it's impressive, but
it's just a crutch to pretend it's substance.
Then this punk just turned his back on Smack to come to King Of The Dot but it was..
suicide, you knew you'd die; it's a cry for help,
‘cause now you've lost everything and everyone; you're all by yourself.
You're like Waldo, playing Where’s Waldo: you need to find yourself.
You can take any bar from any verse from any rounds on me,
and the crowd will safely say that every round’s on me,
and after I get that money tonight, I'm heading straight to the bar,
and you best believe it's gon' be rounds on me.
 (You guys ready to not see gimmicks?)
Alright, that Reader's Digest bar was impressive,
way doper than every other rapper who said it.
This battle was supposed to be for five thousand.
The fuck happened to Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is?
Pussy had Organik call me. (Yes you did)
He said, "That amount of money is life changing.” I said, "He may be right.”
But if five grand is live changing, you need to change your life.
And now I got to rob his parent's crib for fucking up my motivation;
if it was five grand, there wouldn't be any(B&E) reason for this home invasion.
I will kick in the door, shoot the whore. You want more dead? Pistol to your head.
Show me to the safe, and I'll be in the vault quicker than Cortez.
Caustic, Pat Stay, The Saurus, Bigg K, I don't give a fuck who you have involved.
I have evolved; bodies once sloppily rotten are now frozen in catalogs.
Serial killers keep trophies, but I'll take cash in hand.
A thousand for the sacrifice: (What's that?) a rack of lamb.
Well I'll be damned, just to see you live in Hell.
This is Silence Of The Lambs: I hope you're living(live in) well.
It puts the lotion on, live in well? How could he fucking win?
Buffalo Bill wouldn't be comfortable in his fucking skin.
It's heavy builder vers' extra filler; they expect a thriller,
these people crazy. Fuck Steven Avery, even my set(-)up killer.
This is not a new release; it ain't gotta do a piece.
Of course I'm fighting a bum; I made a living on the streets.
Fork in the road, the dead end up on another path.
You should've stayed in your lane; you're fucking trash.
You got a little buzz, thought you'd be a fucking match,
but you gon' die leaving a mark that doesn't last.
Did it sting? Then bring up the fucking past.
Yeah, the Earth quaked, but the magnitude is just an after thought,
‘cause the shit that landed in the building wasn't the same after( )shock.
(Yeah, wasn't was it?)
So is it my fault for being groundbreaking if they didn't get the shit?
See, the future can learn from the past, but not exist in it,
so I'm past that. It's not that he can't rap,
I'm just so ahead of my time, you're currently trapped in a flashback.
You're going to lose a rack flat; was it worth the hype?
You can either wait, or(waiter) or have too much on your plate for the perfect bite.
You see what happens when it's catered? Serves you right.
See, your eyes are bigger than your stomach. That food’s a little closer.
You're gonna realize I'm a killer at large and testing(intestine) me
will be the reason you die just(digest) a little slower.
Now did that shit faze you?
‘Cause they said when I face you, phase one was to break you;
they fucking hate you. Look who they gave you.
Think U.S. pennies, ‘cause you're worth less than the cost it took to make you.
(Early!)
Yo, he just had that Silence Of The Lambs bar,
but that whole scheme was straight up lame.
I'm not Buffalo Bill, I'm Hannibal Lecter,
’cause once Psyco' broke out the pen, there's no saving face.
This round is for everybody who thinks that my shit is all filler.
Now watch me get this body on cam(Cam): Von Miller.
I'll kill him with hands sharper than Wolverine with the titanium blade,
start rearranging your face
'til it looks like you have Hills Have Eyes creature uranium traits,
have your DNA looking bad when the machete spray in your face,
but if you get in my grill and you're grilling, I'm willing to push your grill in,
so start playing it safe.
Stoop Kid from Hey Arnold:
you don't wanna get stepping over stares(stairs), so stay in your place.
It's safe to say, you go down that path,
you'll take a left and a hook on the right like you were asking directions.
You'll be feeling the burn(Bern) like you want Sanders elected.
Having this bitch head in a box like Brad Pitt in Seven,
when you get beat with bare(bear) hands like that Panda in Tekken.
You’ve been acting pretentious,
so I'll leave him stuck up with his nose in the air like this dude's snobby,
walking around with half a face from one hit like a House of The Dead 2 zombie.
When the dude's talking, I'm sending the other hand swinging;
that'll make you bite your tongue like a bad seizure,
hands jabbing like Pan's Labyrinth: the kid'll get eaten if my hands see him,
and beat him, 'til you all see one land like Pangaea.
All sea? One land? Pangaea?
We can see that you don't respect the scene, so I take it as disrespect to me.
This is for every time I stopped at the gas station to take a piss,
and your cousin wouldn't give me the restroom key.
Just you see, it'll be like Calicoe's dad, the way I'm taking off on son.
Get your gang involved, and trust, engage in brawl with us,
the same result then comes, but if engaging’s not enough,
then they can all get clubbed like Megan Fox's thumbs.
I'm not the one.
Last battle I said, "One arm waving got you running home like a third base coach,”
but for you, I brought something worse,
when you see two arms waving like Th3 Saga in church.
You thought that every verse was gonna 3-0 me,
but I'm already amounting two-nothing,
and turned that amount into nothing,
and that's why your bars ain't amounting to nothing,
‘cause this is Everest to a desert strip: this a mountain to nothing.
Dude's bluffing.
This a fire cracker to what happens when you're making an atom split.
You aught to quit cause my attic wit is more adequate than Anne Frank's attic width.
You told OT 7even "shank to his neck, I’m apple picking.” Well ain't that some shit?
One boot will turn his Adam's apple to apple sauce with his larynx squished.
Then I'll reboot him...and not even Steve Jobs could get him his Apple fixed.
That was a Genius Bar.
And against Born you said,
"It's hard when everyone you know’s(nose) crooked like Owen Wilson.”
That was so hot; stop.
Quit acting like you when your folks call the shots,
and lighten your tone like Michael Jackson
before everybody that you know’s(nose) falling off.
This reminds me a little bit like Daylyt vers’ Iron Solomon.
I'm not calling this a mirror match; let me give y'all the clear vision.
This reminds me of Daylyt versus Iron Solomon
‘cause in this battle, you need to self reflect on your mere(mirror) image.
(Early!)
Hibbity, dibbity, flibbity, jibbity-- shut the fuck up.
You want to know what everyone on cam wonders?
How do you spit twice as fast and have half the substance?
You're fucking trash. Look, I appreciate the fans that remain loyal,
but there's a difference between someone that'll lie to you
and someone that'll lie for you.
There's a difference between someone that'll kill for you,
and someone that'll die for you.
That's why I don't give a fuck about your fans.
I can count how many people I trust on Jason Pierre Paul's hands.
Look, don't get defensive or you'll miss the message.
See, I needed a match; he was the natural selection, and I hate that.
It was dramatized, fossilized, let's go way back.
There was a missing link; it seemed our wins didn't explain that.
Now for y'all in the building, who can't rewind or replay that:
“natural selection", "fossilized", "missing link”, “it seemed Darwin didn't explain that”.
See I'm gonna do that all night and clearly kill him,
but first, let's light up the building.
It's time to switch on him like a step child; this next style nastier than a meth smile.
Die from biting: West Nile. Circles change, shape shift, alien reptile.
I'll crack his Skully; thought it was the X-Files.
American Sniper: I'll go from this Kyle to Chris Kyle.
Confirmed kill. It gets worse still.
I use violence to paint the pig; you're a human virus.
Matrix shit, replay, then glitch:
you'll see the same body over and over. Agent Smith.
Which is why we don't cam a lot(Camelot).
This is not your (k)night; everything I spit sort of lands a lot(sword of Lancelot).
This is my kingdom. I alone am ruler;
they measured my successes soon as my foot fit through
It's quicksand. There's a point I'm 'bout to get to.
Struggle and die faster, did it sink in? I'm the last thing you should've ran into.
Why stop when I got more to prove? I'm Cyclops:
this one I(eye) can't afford to lose. I'm in your blind spot.
Don't get stuck in traffic. Oh, you heard the story?
Well it's working for me. Get stuck in the middle: purgatory.
Fans get to judge the living, and the dead; see, it's all an angle.
Thirty pieces of silver and a fallen angel,
hanging with the twelve before I got a cradle,
and made bread off the body before I got the table.
The last supper. Bow your head as I read a verse.
Dear Lord, tonight one of us is going to leave the Earth.
May the peace be with you, ‘cause if I see him first,
parum-pa-pum-pum, all I brought was a drum, like Jesus' birth.
See at first, wise men followed a star.
Nowadays, fuck that, just follow the bars.
(Salute!)
Let’s get it popping, G; I’m here to School(-)boy on cue(Q), no collard greens.
So face it, fam, it's basic math:
I'm the prime one, so you can't even be at odds with me.
I bring Fury to this field like a Ottawa soccer team.
I doctor these pupils: optometry,
running through every body in my path like a Hotel Rwanda scene.
This is Man Vs. Food and it's my job to eat.
Even when I'm freestyling off the top, it's clean;
think Sub Zero from Mortal Kombat: I body frees(freeze).
All these squares around make the game bored(board): Monopoly.
You talk a lot about knocking in noggins clean and socking teeth; stop it, please.
Like couples locked in monogamy rocking promise rings, we never saw you swing.
You say you'll start shooting stars, calm it(comet), please,
or guns(organs) get brought to the table like a Dahmer feast,
long nose in front of your face all day like what Caustic sees,
or catch you and you boo when you're on the streets,
put your boo in a bag like Monster's Inc.
It's odd ‘cause he said he was gonna hurt Diz's career,
then we all just died from laughter
when you forgot your lines at half verse and started calling time quick after.
Hey, you guys wanna know what rhymes with "calling time quick after?"
[Caustic:] Getting bodied by Dizaster!
But tonight you're gonna get it bar for bar,
‘cause that's what everybody here's wanting,
but I didn't write a single jelly fish line,
so tonight no one's gonna have a problem pronouncing this a clear body.
A clear homi, so act a fool and every part you have in you will tear apart,
then black and blue from every scar
and faggot, you will have to prove you carry heart,
when we see this monkey stand up for himself like the evolutionary chart.
Did you hear that Darwinism bar he had in his last round when he said it son?
Yeah, well fuck it, I got a better one.
Are you familiar with the Theory Of Evolution?
‘Cause Darwinism best explains how this match was concepted.
See, you never learned to adapt to the present,
so naturally, it only took one disaster(Dizaster) to end him,
then due to the growth in my bio,(-)logically I was the natural selection.
After you stepped in, it was like Smack had a sex doll fetish,
the way they blew up this fake fuck and gassed his rounds,
while I got slept on by more battle rappers than Organik's couch.
While I had to find a way to try to pay to fly the states,
and trapped in the traffic lines for days, the price was waived right away
for this guy to take the diamond lane to the fastest route,
so the staff on Smack is over half the reason they have him out,
so The King Of The Dot was happy to have him out,
but I'll be happy when we have him out.
But after now, I ain't takin losses, but if they say I lost then
I'm taking off rocking The King Of The Dot chain with Illmaculate hanging off it.
You were taking off when your PG release lifted
his weak image, to be pictured like he's an elite figure;
now they use your bull pen for a warm up like relief pitchers.
You use historical figures and facts that are bound to be
convincing for half the crowd to think it's skill, but in actuality,
it's a gimmick you have to cloud to scheme,
with your simplicity masked as challenging,
‘cause the significant fact left out of these writtens you have are found to be
missing the factuality and littered with massive fallacies
and hidden within a fictitious image with little in practicality.
For example, you told JC,
”They knew I was gonna sleep you as soon as they set a date.”
Set a date/sedative. That's a reach.
Then you said, "I could beat you with the bars I land of the free if the pen in gone"
Pen in gone/pentagon. That's a reach.
Then you said,
"you'll all get fed embalming fluid unless you find somewhere for ‘em all to hide.”
For ‘em all to hide/formaldehyde. That's a reach.
You can battle John John in a Mosque and still out rhyme a don.
Out rhyme a don/Ramadan. That's a reach.
Faggot, please. There's an obvious gap in everything you say.
Getting reaction off bars that don't make sense
only makes you look stupid in the long run. Just ask DNA.
Round three, it's getting hot in here. King Of The Dot, y'all know that slogan.
[Crowd:] Get him the fuck out of here!
Hell no, get the beanie on this geek the fuck out of here.
You're afraid of immigration; get this Syrian refugee the fuck out of here.
Half your bars don't even make sense, get every fucking reach the fuck out of here.
I killed rappers Back To Back here because I love Toronto;
somebody get Meek the fuck out of here.
Yo, who the fuck is he talking to every round?
You better make like a bitch in her wedding gown and settle down.
Oh, you made(maid) of honor? Well we are not the same.
A loss in reality, I'm how he got a name.
I ignore pain and press your(pressure) points. What an easy win,
look how you act. You punked your(acupuncture)self. Why needle him?
You're so close to death like senior citizens.
Needle, sew clothes?
No joke, while he was thinking about what to write next,
I was doing random licks like dyke sex.
Bitch head in the box, since you mention the movie Seven,
guess you could use a lesson on who to threaten.
There goes all of Rob progress like a 2-11.
Robbery in progress? 2-11?
Plus I said his name. Jesse James, it is Robert right?
Well, if I'm robbed tonight,
as in, you skip town and you're found alive,
leave with the cash and the judges are on his side,
he'll be the next Robert(robber) to die famous like Bonnie and Clyde.
So run and hide. You do not want to be Robert E. Lee.
Granted, history repeats, except I'm leaving a twist:
fuck being Civil, War is where you'll, uh, cease(Ulysses) to exist.
Bitch, I slave over linking(Lincoln) these concepts, no exaggeration,
but there's still free dumb(freedom) for Blackout like emancipation.
Run the chain.
Rone and 'Mac, hunger— hold on, I'm still battling what’s-his-name. What a shame.
‘Cause outside of KOTD, you are not known.
You are just a captive, I would've capped if you affected my Stockholm.
Stockholm; you're skull and bones right away.
Kidnapped, locked away. Escape alive? Not today.
Ransom, you gotta pay. Danger, two kind of ways:
Lotta Zay or Jonbenet, I’ve got to say.
For another four K, you would've got a person buried.
Rem—, I'm not a Hitman, I'm a mercenary.
A pallbearer; don't get carried away. This is not a classic.
I'm Paul Bear Bryant: I'm coaching him in the casket.
See this is what happens when you get it backwards,
when animals run the zoo and get to pick the matches.
You get the poor vers' the top one-percent; we're in different classes.
Show me where the cash is.
I'm Ali before the Frasier fight.
Fuck a war, you know my name. Gjonaj, say it right.
I'll be remembered as a legend; you're a man forgotten.
Your material has a shelf life; it's black and rotten.
It expired before you did, and that’s the problem.
I'd rather make you a current event than rap about 'em.
I had to show him what the difference is,
‘cause feeding lambs to the wolves seem ignorant,
but what's a shepherd do when the sheep ain't listening?
(Goodnight!)
Nitty, tonight, I advise there be no horse-playing. Bring your best.
This was a fresh move. For you, still a L, ‘cause I ain’t Chess.
They said my style placed me top of the rookies.
Well, I feel like Trey in the crib,
‘cause punching with tiers(tears) finally got me this pussy.
Nitty, what’s goody? Fuck that you brought your block for support,
‘cause I can tell these niggas not what you thought.
The first Quarter with a problem getting dropped, but if a Glock the resort,
you’ll hear shots popping quads(pop in Quad); think Pac in New York.
See, quarters is Quads, the same place where niggas set it on Pac.
Nitty, you just a stepping stone to help me get to the top,
but apparently being drugged is your plot.
Y’all think not? He was fiending to be on Smack; now he begging for Roc(k).
But they sent me to put to put the chalk to him,
so if I Am Legend, then watch how I wash dog while I talk to him.
Just ‘cause The Poet mark you a genius,
that don’t mean you on point, son, ‘cause you on Kevin(’s) Johnson in Phoenix.
I get to sparking these ninas,
well, you’ll be Denzel in He Got Game: go from the box to you talking with Jesus.
See, y’all the reasons niggas thinking they’re tough,
‘cause repping that Fourth Quarter only means shit’ll change for a buck.
Hold up. See, all this crip shit you spit out your mouth
don’t mean nothing when my niggas en route.
He’ll white flag once my click at his house;
that’s when you see these niggas In Living Color,
‘cause after the first clip, the bitches come out.
I mean, these Fourth Quarter niggas ain’t hard. They scared for ya;
soon as you fired on, they(day) off: go Craig on ya,
or I’ll rob you ’til your bread’s shorter.
Put that drum(-)stick to your thigh;
you either come off the chicken or lose a leg, Quarter.
But you ain’t in the streets at all, you bum.
Your heart weren’t strong enough to run that base: you John Q’s son.
You strapped up? Well, I’m armed too, chump; the war’s started.
Fuck your vest; let it scream on caps: I’m Troy Martin.
Wait, pardon. No sparking, gun butt with the mean grip.
The serial(cereal) smack his face like he riding with Queenzflip,
‘cause we ain’t slip with straps. What’s cooking?
I’m on my Voletta Wallace: I brought that Big popper(Poppa) back through Brooklyn,
so fuck Rum. Besides, I be drinking on that Henny,
so ain’t shit to leave him stinking from a semi-.
They gassed him up, thinking he gon’ hit me,
but he don’t want to be the one sent(cent) to face the right:
that’s Lincoln on a penny.
And I still got the weapons to end it,
so you can go from the right to bare(bear) arms, like the second amendment.
I extended the sweetest piece,
so if Beas’ need this West Coast nigga dead by thirty, I’ll make it Ea(z)y, E.
He ain’t beating me, nor none of these fucking faggots.
If you got rage to come after Ave, just don’t be average,

‘cause you talking it like they’re straight killers.
Soon as he hooked, put money on their book like it’s JPay.
I don’t care if you crip bang, bitch.
One shot’ll finish this Fourth Quarter in Phoenix; I don’t Bull in the game, six.
Y’all pump packs and shit?
Wait, backtrack. Fourth quarter, Phoenix, that game six shot was Paxson, bitch.
I stash that fifth and beat the foul out ya,
then point it at the back of the head: that’s Alfalfa.
It ain’t nothing tough ‘bout ya. See, I stay fight-ready,
and I’ll off the nigga cap: that’s CakeLyfe Prezzy.
How he gon’ check me? Y’all gassing this nigga like he goes so hard.
It’s with a scam and on the card; you like a Zoe God,
but you ain’t getting real dough, nigga.
Nobody on foot(-)ball between bars but a field goal kicker.
I fear no nigga, so let him be stupid to prove he truly swing;
put a clear round in this pussy: my shooters NuvaRing.
Fuck who he bring, ‘cause if they cross them trenches,
he the first down, soon as he get to Fourth and inches.
Wait, but you’re Writer’s Bloque, right?
Well, where the fuck them clowns when you need them?
Soon as J see(JC) the Big (K)cannon, them rounds gon’ delete him,
but Danny get the shotty right in his mouth when I meet him;
think Yo Gotti, ‘cause soon as It Goes Down, end of(In the) D.M.
And since Magic want to know who’s a new killer,
y’all know The Answer.
Hey, I(A.I.) can shoot and reenact how you step over Lou(Lue) niggas.
Fuck what this clown come spit,
‘cause when I’m smoking the Fourth Quarter, it only mean he down one (-) zip.
We got Rum Nitty vers’ Ave. Damn.
Smack got me moving backwards. You don’t see that I’m the truth?
It’s like I dropped a tier(tear) to give you this shot: I’m Nino on the roof.
Don’t leave out the venue, or see niggas squeezing out the coupe.
My white boy from Queens say, “Soon as your done leave, he(Dunleavy) fi’n’a shoot.
They brought the best to him,
and they bet. Norbes and Myers put paper down for this shit: public restroom.
Let’s get to it. I’ll fuck your bitch pussy with the nine barrel. Nitty tripping.
Make sure your girl’s tore(tour) with the mill’(Mill) like Drizzy dissing;
then he gets it. If I forget the mittens,
I’ll slide through with two socks on the Tom: that’s Risky Business.
Or he get the blade; stick it his temple, twist it,
pull it out, and run it back in your head like you’re reminiscing.
The punch crazy, but the setup get caught later like Jimmy Henchman.
I’m dope, nigga. I’ll OD in this bitch if I come out the coat with it,
then mark you out before the chest shot: Pulp Fiction.
If I whip the piece, your family’s fucked.
Headshot your mom’s sister; they gon have to M.O.P. your auntie(Ante) Up,
handle what? Niggas dying. You’ll see the flash from behind when the milli’ light him.
That was fire, coming from the background like Gwitty hyping.
Lift the iron; I’ll let a dummy go off the top like 50 Tyson.
But they say you washing me.
I said, “Cool. Cut the check, and he’s who I’ma air out next(necks) like a tracheotomy.
Don’t lie to me, ‘cause I’ll be at your crib knocking with a big fifth, that bitch Shining.
Catch what the nickel send(Nicholson) through the door, nigga, here’s Johnny.
Something fat in a little coat; it’ll be a big body.
Catch the Tommy, Boy, it rip your back like Chris Farley.
If I raise, shit sparking.
I’ll let that bitch go *blakka*(block a), nigga, like he Facebook stalking.

I’ll be at your door and all.
The whole house’ll rest(arrest),
‘cause that shit you on ain’t cool; you took it too far, now I’m going off.
I know he’s soft. From the jump I get it in, so Many Men die when the coin toss.
Nah. I got a hundred in the drum to get busy with.
He try to run, guess whose back get 50 sent(Cent) in it.
I lock and load, riding out with the squad for sho.
Fourth. I get it jumping for the Quarter off top, nigga, I’m the G.O.A.T.,
fucking maricon. Two shots leave Roc(k) laid on Ave; it look like cobblestone.
You copy, holmes? One from the can pop at him;
I’ll let it fly. It Will break up Ave like Hancock landing.
What your hands like, family? You’ll get your chin broken.
Right, left, left, right, you’ll get clocked back and forth like hypnosis.
I’m a forty sparker; I’ll let it wet across your forehead like holy water.
He knows we’re talking; me, I’ll lift it and squeeze.
He try to dip, then this shit erase a (eraser) back like when your earring missing a piece.
Gun line king. I used to let the can go daily.
Beam on it; I’d inf’ a mill’(Infamil) and catch you with the semi- lack(Similac),
and that’s what the can’s for, baby(cans for baby).
We don’t keep it cool. Real life shit, I keep a tool. Pull it, squeeze, and shoot.
Let ten open up on his face like peek-a-boo.
He done joined the Cave. So now he think he royal every time he come around, right?
Well I’ll give you kings ten,(Kingston) Ave. Head shot, lift your Crown Heights.
I’ll run inside, lace your crib, shooting over the table shit. Take his ribs.
Bet five racks I won’t miss this trash nigga; I’m Money Making Mitch.
Real shit. You can’t keep it real yourself.
Nigga, suicide or I’ll do the job; you decide. Kill yourself.
Hottest in the city; they heard that I'm really poppin'.
I'm good on every block; I ain't gotta be milli'(Milly) Rockin'.
Ave nice, and the last dude to doubt that, nigga died fuckin' with the bars.
He went out like Blizzard; you get the picture.
I was plannin' to kill you in the future.
They wanted to see the king this March: I'm Martin Luther.
You just hyped up where you matter, but now that I get at 'em (atom/Adam),
even (Eve) they see you bodied, bitch, that ain't bitin' in the Apple.
I'ma snap him, take it past rap, I bet I'll leave him there,
as soon as I eyeball a Quarter like I don't need the scale.
Tell your people bail, 'cause I won't e'en speak,
just *shhh* aim(shame) on a nigga, then I O.D., B.
But he ain't gotta get the Glock, goddamn it.
Nigga, he'll be socked up like when you give a backshot standing.
I could handle him with a mean right,
but on the other hand, a pump can (pumpkin) light up the face like Halloween night.
They just seem hype, you know, clown face, sound brave,
throw they fours up like they wild, that's what wild raised;
that shit for the crowd, ace.
Bet if we scrap, y'all gon' see his troops(') jet in the back:
that's Colonel Guile's stage.


It's child's play; the Internet digging this fuckin' clown,
You think you Pac? Well try to be (D)igital (U)nderground.
'Cause can't no fuckin' dummy play me.
My little dog be goin' bananas, kickin' cans; even my puppy monkey, baby.
But I ain't get patted down, I'm concealin' a Smith n',
so watch your lips when a real nigga spittin'.
I go to kickin' my rounds and hear these clowns or get the feelin' they trippin',
I'll dump the forty while I'm cookin': that's steel in the kitchen.
You see the difference? With punches I'm a animal, duke,
even handle you with the hands (Hans), 'cause these zoo landers too(Zoolander 2).
See, I can beat this geek up,
or with the stick cap a round on the eye, then shell his body like he Mr. Peanut.
Y'all got me fucked up. What, y'all don't think that we hold lead?
I kick up in the spot, that glock to his forehead;
if he don't open up that box for the bread,
then what he face even uglier if locks get cut: that's O-Red.
Then I'm Swayze when that shotty through spittin',
'cause as soon as you see the bitch run up on me, watch the body get lifted.
Who wanna (D)irty (D)ance? Thirty in the can sparkin',
twenty-five in the 4th Quarter like Reggie in The Garden.
You don't wanna lose your life right here.
You'll end up with a light pop at the head; now that's a bright idea.
My nigga Law told me punch out silly; Rum on a roll.
Well I'll end it, Ty; I doubt it if this bird out-spit me,
See, he ain't even peep that word out, did he?
I said: "end(N) it, Ty" put that together; I ain't worried 'bout Nitty,
'cause Cornell's not a shotta,
I'll flush Corn' and your shit. You'll pass, but you won't die just(digest) proper.
I'll get him popped up. Matter of fact, naw, I'll kill his ass,
dome shot, head hit his shoulder, look like the Thriller dance.
See, I could give him jabs, 'cause that left done left a lot shook,
or hold a round at the neck, look what the shot put (shotput).
That Glock cook, but the rifle round is madness.
I'll touch through the lens: that's Calvin glasses.
Or I'll catch him with his folks hangin', close-rangin', low aimin',
both bangers ringin' together look like I'm rope swingin'.
Bro think I'm joking, but I'll smoke him on the scene,
two grips rippin' his shirt: he Hogan in the ring.
Fuck you mean? You know we talk that slick talk. That stick talk,
bullet in his shoe if he move; now tell this Crip walk.
So you and Roc family now huh? Boy, that shit fake.
I whip a big blade, it’s about one foot; it’s for your kin, Tay (Kinte).
Get slayed, stand over the body with a stick; wait.
You’re number 2 in your city, you’re used to being under a big k (Bigg K).
I’m straight to it; I be going for blood from the jump.
Radio Raheem rings: I don't show a hater love(hate or love) when I punch.
Get your mug pushed in. Jump, I'll let a slug cook him.
Ironic how I’m going to destroy Ave (diss Troy Ave), but I love Brooklyn.
Just expect I’ma shoot you.
You press my buttons, soon as I see money, I’ma pull out; does this register to you?
You thinkin I’ma get killed, that’s grimy,
'cause what I kick, give you three clear rounds to the side, like an Air Max 90.
I’m finna have the blueprint to kill this geek if this works out.
Y’all ain’t peep Verb vs. SB? I started off with the remedy (Remy’D) in the first round.
I let it ring.
If he survive, your man in(Manning) surgery next(neck);
he come back and get the second ring.
I'll visit your city with ‘matics popping, and I’m robbing,
trying to get rid of your House In Virginia like Magic Johnson.


I’ll clap an artist. Good shot: that’s a marksman.
Pull a bow and put an arrow in his face; Ave a target (avatar).
I send my young niggas dumping out the steel.
They let one off; that first pop warn a(Pop Warner) nigga how the young'ns in the field.
For real. I got a clip full of hollows for whoever talk.
I’ll leave four of these bitches smoking on your roof like Set It Off.
No matter vet or a rookie,
'cause I been letting loose ever since I came out, baby,
but the key goes (kegels) to flex on a pussy.
Pussy. Get pistol whipped with the Mac. I’ll Big Pun a bitch,
so if this guy goes (goggles) upside your head it’s Capital Punishment.
Suck a dick. I’m known to smoke bitches.
I’ll make a nice nigga hang it up. Literally, you missed the punch;
that means I’ll rope a dope nigga.
I gotta aim slanted when I hold the four spitting.
Sideways, I'll peel out a round on Ave, like I’m Tokyo Drifting.
Behind these bars, he going through some shit: Shawshank escape.
I get it popping. Pet adoption: I put a dog in his place.
I give a fuck if a nigga big; I’ll be all in his space.
You can be Tyson cut; don’t mean you want parts in a fade.
But y’all call it shaking right? Cool, I got you a little later.
The nina kill him. Two of these’ll peel him.
I’ll black and let it fly in his face like Feed the Children.
You type done. You’ll lose all train of thought when the nine dump.
A head shot'll make him blank it (Blanket) out like Mike’s son.
I’ll light one. You make a move and get done dirty,
the D.E. take off size if you jump early.
Remain calm, or the blade on him,
then I run it across Ave like I’m jaywalking.
‘Tez on Twitter, acting like he want smoke; okay, partner.
If the fifth in the shorts, then I’m whipping it on Cort’ (court) like James Harden.
I’ll straight box him; he say something crazy, I’ma swing.
2K free throw: soon as he get to the line, we get it shaking on the screen.
Don’t try and scare me. I got nice hands and something nice handy,
and I’ll pop a round (around) in your life like a white family.
KG gave me the extra magazine like “you might want to beware, not scared.”
You'll get a headshot. That clip I got from Kevin, bakin’(Bacon); I’ll let it air up there.
And your squad can’t jump in; this is your bag.
Joey Jihad shit: you gotta take these punches on your own(,) Ave.
I don’t like you bitches,
so watch the boy from the Quarter(-)black and enlighten niggas.
Large slug, I ice you with it;
nothing small’s in the clip, the little nigga spit big (B.I.G) 16s like Sky’s the Limit.
Real shit, you can’t keep it real yourself.
Nigga, suicide or I’ll do the job, you decide. Kill yourself.
To all you little niggas sending shots at the game, scram.
Switch up your game plan,
'cause shit changed; don’t send a shot that’s way out your range. Damn,
like get this in your brains, fam.
Before you make a Roc(k) round you gotta’ see Ave first;
that’s on the Cave, man(caveman).
Don’t even play if y’all ain’t killers,
'cause you gon' have to be more than sharp for Tay;
you know Roc(k) breaks scissors.
But now that I’m up in the picture, nigga, step to me.
Go ‘head and sleep, but as soon as I catch you restin’, peace.
See I’m that nigga in the East; they was checkin’ for me.
Basically, you get to eat off my flow(floor): I’m Victor Sweet.

Now that’s where we’re different, geek, 'cause see, I been 'bout that action.
Thirty under the forty, that’s an improper fraction.
I clap whatever pop in his mind,
so you’ll be dead before Smack transform him, first Op to miss(Optimus) Prime.
Never mind, 'cause they don’t need him.
Maybe I can leave him undercover 'til he next to God; I’ll J. Reid him.
Who can’t see him? My flow skill only proves that he’s road kill.
I’ll beat him at his own style with a touch, give it that Rogue feel.
And oh, fuck that punchline belt that they say you hold, queer,
'cause I’ll put a tip to that title(Tidal) like it’s a HOV deal.
I’m so ill. My flow Hell bro,
Shit, I done took plain bars and washed bodies like hotel soap.
I’ll let a shell go, but he ain’t got the heart to be strapped.
Don’t no niggas in Phoenix ring; blame Barkley for that.
I got smokers that clap; nigga, they stay with it.
Told ‘em soon as they see his whip, let that HK hit it,
but I don’t need cash to pay they ticket.
Shit, I can slide a cookie on that car like DayDay did it.
You wanna take a thug’s gamble?
Well understand I’m strapped and fat on both sides, nigga, I love handles.
So fuck beef, 'cause we run to it.
Sign on a pair of Penny's: watch the tongue before you see(C) one(1) through it.
But you ain’t stupid, and you know that if we rumble you out,
so why speak what you don’t want to be 'bout?
Just be humble; don’t go running your mouth,
or you can get a buck fifty up front: I’ll start his own GoFundMe account.
See, they doubt us 'cause we some South hittas.
Well I’m in your cotton picking yard holdin’ my Uncle(') Tom.
Come out the house(,) nigga.
Big mouths get a fucking bum murked up,
'cause I doubt if he hold steel(still) like your son’s first cut.
It’s all a bluff. Y’all buying all this reckless shit he talk?
I mean he ain’t really shooting: he Tom Sheppard in the park.
So put your state on the map and just chill;
keep it rap before that AR is on a (Arizona) nigga back for real.
You see the skill. They kill for the type of shit Ave writes;
I’m John Stockton with a dish to Malone, I’m past(passed) nice.
Make your riders pay bucks up front like a cab price,
so when your team cap(ped) right on the head, that’s draft night,
'cause you bad, right? Cool. Well those shots will get fatal.
Let him run; shit, we ain’t done. Spin the block like a Dreidel.
And we ain’t worried about the jakes, dog; we play raw.
If I don’t feel it’s a big risk(wrist), fuck it: that’s Ray Charles.
But see, y’all support these bluffs,
meanwhile, I got a nigga trying to fight (J)ustice, like Chicago with the brush.
So before you start acting all hype from your Yes man,
just know, life ain’t make you six feet, but death can.
See, you sayin’ shit to fit for the footage,
'cause where I’m from, we’re gon' pull it,
long as it got the firing pins to the bullets.
A high point 40 saved my life; I fell in love with that.
That plastic was popping them rounds, and it weren’t bubble wrap.
But KG claim the West on your back,
but when you shot and end up in a Heavy Bag, thank Kevin for that.
So I hope he brung his chopper, 'cause soon as we done, partner,
niggas get lumped proper; we still owe them one for Hoffa.
Now I ain’t making this no West Side hate,
but if it’s poppin’ shit, then part two, they said Next(,) fry Day(Friday),
'cause I don’t play. That tough shit he saying made up.
Straight fable. You sex on cable: fake fuck,
'cause you talk it like you banging that steel,
but see, I really doubt if B be gunnin'(B.B. gun) unless you thinking like Bill.
See I can punch him to death. Not just with bars though,
my hands is a problem; I’ll leave him lumped up bad as Apollo.
See I ain’t only got to blast him with hollows.
I mean the Bible says, "Thou shall not steal." That’s the only commandment I follow.
I know I’m sinning, lord.
No, *BLAOW*, look who I’m sending, lord.
You'll see a Quarter flipped in the battle, like the beginning, or,
squeeze this round, well I can leave the semi now,
'cause they ain’t getting the prints(prince) like Patrice McDowell.
I got now. I told you fix my plate right Smack?
'Cause they’ve been sleeping, it’s time I bring my state right back.
I don’t give a fuck about these sucka niggas; they type whack.
'Cause I’m a nigga out of Norfolk, straight like that.
Shit can get real Ms. Gracie, my nigga.
I know what y’all thinking; wait. y’all thinking weight.
Nah, overkill; two hands over the mil'(meal),
that’s what I was saying(,) Grace.
A headshot in front of a crowd, he’ll go a crazy way,
but giving him the steel in his chest(Chess) really takes the Cake.
For the record, I’ll deal with you, like label mates.
I’m nice; even when I fuck up it’s a dope error(era) like '88.
He be talking like his gun dump,
but won’t say it to the kid. I’ll lift a nine in his face like I’m Nunn Nunn.
You ain’t use your head; think.
Better go watch my last shit again. That’ll make a young nigga fear the Pen;
he'll be scared straight.
I don’t lead waste; I’m only aiming to stretch him.
If I miss you, baby it’s gonna be okay; I got Faith I'ma X him.
Get did bad.
Bullets knock your man’s hat in the streets for talking East/West;
I’ll split you with the fifth, Ave(5th Ave).
Quick bag. The PG never had a shot; don’t be shocked if the kid pass.
Let thirty out the thing.
Saga vs. Chilla: tryin' to make his back slide with a dirty magazine.
But they say his rounds poppin' and I don’t want no trouble with that,
I’m just too damn(two Damme) different like Double Impact.
Facts. One(-)nine’ll clap;
your spine’ll crack from this old Colt. They gon' have to reunite his(Unitas) back.
'Cause I can scrap. Go across his chin, try the left,
or I right(write) shit to flip the script, that’s the Butterfy Effect.
Get ran through. I used to keep a nina on me 'cause I had to,
and on them long nights, Coors Light: shit got cold, the can blew(blue).
But you? On my life, nigga's sweet.
Can’t catch me slippin’; I’ll commit assault(salt) on Ave like it’s ice on the street.
Get stomped out if my squad started.
You’ll have fifty niggas turning up on Ave: that’s a block party,
but he fuck with the law probably,
so I shouldn’t waste my breath on a rat; I ain’t John Coffey.
But niggas blow smoke, no action,
so if he miss a step, the five getting whipped from the belt; I go Joe Jackson.
Pull up gang bangin’, hopping out the four-door flaggin',
and on site(sight) I’ll pick you off like they photo flagged him.
I’m known for that. Mid-battle, a forty clap,
that shit’ll stop Ave dead in a round like a cul-de-sac.
My style belong on Smack. I’m that sure, you dig me?
Y’all remember I'm Gonna Git You Sucka?
Well, me not stepping on the platform is fishy.
And me vers' the niggas you wanna see,
it won’t happen; I come at them, they run from me,
so I can only kill what rap niggas Smack put in front of me,
but first they ain’t want to fuck with me,
and I'd've made it to the stage quicker if I had done a PG or been from the East,
but I battled Rex, Red, Ars, Lotta, Magic.
For me to come to the East and do a PG, that’s backwards,

but I still made it to the stage without that shit,
So facts is, I ain’t earned my respect, I snatched it.
So you can’t put me in that box. I’m sorry.
I done traveled all over the atlas,
but y’all think I’m gonna come back to the Ave and get ran off? I’m not Safari.
The Mac raise, I’m dropping every nigga out the bat cave,
but first it started on the Ave like the old SMACK days.
"New York, New York, big city of dreams." Y’all remember that Snoop shit.
Well I brought in my dog pound and let it kick in the building like Snoop did.
Just worry about the bars and don’t worry what I got on,
but if you is worried, LOMClothing.com.
Bitch I already told him,
I’m 99% gun lines; the other one is the slogan:
Kill yourself.
What you gon' hear today is the mother of all anti-Semitic hate raps.
This is revenge for all the dead children that fell victim from way back.
This here is for every single Arab.
Shit, even the Christians are going to feel like they're getting their payback
once I rape your mother in the ass with no protection,
bare back wearing a Mel Gibson facemask.
You know what rhymes with bar mitzvah?
(Crowd: What?) Swastika.
Let's see where you at, Iron.
Let's see if Solomon can handle this.
Today I'ma put you through some body building championships:
you gon' get pushed to your max(,) Iron.
Straighten out your act here(hair),
‘cause any hot headed shit will get you laid out flat(,) Iron.
Today I'ma run laps around him 'til he get exhausted
and I tire Iron like he had a flat tire,
‘cause he never had drive he just stood on the side and watched me pass by him.
He's past his prime, so ain’t no use for him to come back fighting;
the last time anyone gave a fuck about Iron's mic is when we had Tyson,
so if Iron make a come back for one last time, he gon' get smashed like him
You been pussy since GrizzleMania, ducking and diving,
always playing it about being safe than surviving.
I know you vanished away and take cover so it ain’t no surprise in
that once he takes cover, there ain't no way I'ma find him
‘cause Annie Frank used to guide him,
so I know she told you all the perfect places to hide in.
Yeah, Anne Frank. What a damn skank.
Someone pass me my gas tank.
I am Hitler, the real Heinrich Himmler; sieg heil to your wife and sister.
You've been on two lists your whole life, mine and Schindler’s.
I asked you to battle me the first time, you said no. The second time, you said no.
If you would've flaked this time, it would've been your third right(Reich) in a row.
I said, I thought you would flake. I'm honestly shocked you would take me.
Had me feeling like Pesci all day:
I started sweating, thinking he wouldn't have the balls to face me.
But now that we here Iron, I know who your father is.
You grew off of Little Mermaid royalties
since we were in third grade, you was always rich.
The reason you fell off is this:
it's the work ethic, you never have to work hard for shit. You never starved for shit.
Anything you asked daddy for, you would always get.
See, you that fat guy that walked into the gym, got on a treadmill and jogged a bit,
but you never stayed on it for long enough to even break no body sweat,
so now you stuck in the same plateau you haven't evolved from since,
but use your common sense.
You've been living off a false sense of accomplishment,
‘cause if you worked hard like all us did, you would've not have quit.
You would’ve probably thought of it and realized, "Nah, I worked too hard for this.
I'm Iron Solomon. I'll come back and demolish them.”
Where's your gladiator armor kit, your heart of Spartacus,
your "I am Sparta” shit? Come on, dog, you got this shit.
I'm giving you back all your confidence, you soaking all this in?
You know I normally charge for this.
I'm just saying, you was a legend to all of us,
but when you're in the room, your energy isn't really felt.
Trying to yell your bars to us,
your vocal projection just never hits hard enough
like uh, {snaps fingers} like a Math Hoffa punch.
But where's your voice? Aren't you Jewish? You celebrated so many Hanukkahs
that by now you supposed to have way more presents(presence) than all of us.
We used to call you a pioneer.
You went from that to letting your bitch re-write your third round for Daylyt.
Wait a minute, you let your broad re-write all your hard work and tears?
You take advice from someone else? Wait, y'all don't think this weird?
Honestly, you can call it how you want to call it, but to me all this shit is clear;
Iron Man could never get the job done without someone like Jarvis talking in his ear.
Makes sense you Tony Starks though,
’cause every time you get picked apart in a battle it's back to the lab,
to have your bitch walk around holding up the pad helping you charge up for a year.
That's why Tony Starks is never as solid as he appears;
you've always been in constant fear.
The Iron suit is just an outer part, the center piece is hollow up in here;
Iron Man has had an artificial heart from the start of his career.
Now look at where your life's at.
See, you were fine 'til you tried Smack, but you can't deny facts,
that if Iron himself had that type of endurance, then he might last,
but he left too much of a wide gap
where he didn't focus on his time, on his rhyme craft,
so if you paid more attention in science class,
you would know that Iron becomes rusty when you let too much time pass.
These bars I drop got knowledge in 'em.
Darwinism: Charles Dickens versus non-fiction DNA mama level autism,
plus, your father scripted all of Oscar The Grouch's shit for Sesame Street
So now I know where you enherit all your garbage writtens.
Yeah, you fell off, you got to admit it.
You should've move to New Orleans and got an apartment to live in
with a bunch of tsunami victims
so you can share stories all day about how you're washed up with 'em.
This is God’s gifted. I’m God gifted.
Watching me spit is like a game of Twister,
’cause I can catch bodies back to back with my skills on the spot,
and that's the reason you got us all twisted.
I mean, you the best freestyler? Explain how.
Yo, back in the day,
if you didn't recycle so much you wouldn't even have a name now,
and I'm gonna explain how,
you know the, "you're behind on California time" you told TheSaurus?
That was the second time you recycled those same rounds.
Let's play a game of “I Swear” now.
Say, “I swear on my newborn child,
I didn't use those lines in a battle with Okwerdz that never came out.”
Look at his face now.
You look like you just got caught in a stupid lie.
You have a better chance of getting Sasha Cohen
to show up here dressed up as Borat in a suit and tie,
‘cause that's the only way this crowd gon’ get to see
another Arab get played by a Jewish guy.
I'm trying to get y'all to see, that's he's the fakest freestyler that’s on the scene,
but y'all don't see it.
Y'all just obsessed with these little pussies like a bunch of Carter Deems.
He's a dead man walking; he's almost in his coffin, he's just caught in between.
He got one window to get outside of this box he’s in;
I got him inside of a laundry machine.
And that's the irony(Iron, he) in it, ‘cause even if Iron makes it out of it clean,
all it means is me and Iron still got to iron out some things,
I mean, we gon' get right down to the tee.
Even if you don't like how it seems(seams),
if he don't tell me what his true religion is...
fuck it, I'ma find out when he gets {punches air} right out of his jeans.
How was that? How was that for an ironing theme?
Or, I got a different type of Iron scheme.
I'll take an Iron Fist to Iron’s cheek like the Iron Sheik,
and you wouldn’t dare fight me inside the ring.
I wish he would try me; even if I tried him, he wouldn't try a thing.
Even if Iron was Tiger Woods you wouldn't see Iron swing.
But you'll probably rap about Math for three rounds.
If you do, then be prepared to throw hands with me now.
If you did, it would be like the Shazaam app: you’ll quickly catch a beat down.
I don't give a fuck if you think I'm emotional, bitch.
If you've been acting tough like Andy Dump,
we can go outside and box over this shit.
I'm about to hit him with the fucking closer, ‘cause I don't care.
Kill yourself, ‘cause even if you did, people would probably still won't care.
Take your Spring Fever CD, walk through a black hole,
get lost in the middle of nowhere,
and don't forget to take Adam Sandler
and all his gay ass movies with you when you go there.
Oh, fuck. I made my own bed;
when I was dormant, I gave y'all reason to snooze on me.
Tonight, we putting that to rest. Y'all still sleeping, then you zombies.
What you'll see is a true homi,t hat looks like lipo to you prob’ly,
‘cause he's gonna suck, and I'ma get a new body.
This throne is my home, I came back for the upkeep.
Retard strength: all your battles are dumb weak.
This quack will be duck meat for flapping too much beak;
I'm doing my numbers on the web: duck feet.
If you fucked The Saurus's mother, forty-some weeks
before The Saurus was born, you couldn't compete(cum Pete).
If you wouldn't come east, I'd come confront him in the west.
I'd throw hands across America; every fucking punch connects.
You a one and done at best, I'm the one who done it best.
Big killers sleep in a guillotine: a cut above the rest.
I'm the recoil that'll leave your gun hand crushed.
True artist, I paint pictures with a drum and brush.
I'm the one man band that ?uestlove can't touch,
serve food for Thought like The Roots front man's lunch.
Do You Want More?!!!??!
Your Halflife starts once Organik/Organix flips the coin,
’cause that's When Things Fall Apart,
and this is just The Tipping Point for now, brother.
I'ma milk this; my style butter. The crowd love me like the cow's utter in Calcutta.
The savior. The Christians praying to Jesus(Spanish pronunc.);
to Jews I am Moses. To Pagans, I’m they Zeus.
Walk the crowd like the holy ghost strolling through the convent.
You can smell Jehovah's odor on me; I am God-sent(scent).
You will never see me lose to this old Lebaneser Scrooge.
They booked a death machine for you. I suggest you think it through;
You'll get digested, eaten, chewed; you a recipe for food.
Step inside the lion's den, you don't get to leave the zoo.

Photo by Christian Andrabado for BattleRap.com.A different pedigree than you; that's why I would like to question,
what did you bring to the game? What makes this guy some type of legend?
Working twenty years on his precise refined impression
of Eminem’s exact style from 1997?
This Afgan a Stan. Such a-rabid(Arab) fan,
your whole style’s cut from someone else's cloth: you Dapper Dan.
With a master plan to spit some multi-syllable shit
to distract the fans while you spit some old silly bullshit.
Get out the kiddie pool, Diz. You supposed to be an adult.
You keep getting old, but we don't seem to see the results.
You're just a Lost Boy, Peter Pan whose punchlines Never Land;
when D's in bad form, he needs a Hook to get a hand.
I mean for real, what's this guy's problem? Tinkerbell is what I call him.
He got dusted, and did some fairy shit to keep the light on him.
"I want views like Fetty Wap to get the blind to see,
I(eye) only got to sock it(socket) to get where I should be."
Lash out and patch it up, nothing's cornier(cornea).
What you've become gave battles astigmatism: disappointed at what my pupil's done.
In hindsight, the Bay Watched you hassle Hoffa(Hasselhoff) for limelight,
and this guy's hype off of that surprise fight like that's a prize fight.
Even though we know you only go to blows if it's staged right,
the irony, that this homophobe's fans support gay rights.
Had your people riding the benches, jumped right in the trenches.
You got some grimy intentions with you inside of these legends.
See to me, turning battles into fights is just senseless,
but cross the line, this battle will bare a striking resemblance.
‘Cause I’m a wig splitter, I'm a ditch digger, I’m a shit kicker and I'm a bit bitter.
You a quick pitcher; I'm a big swinger. Won't be the one running; I'm a pinch hitter.
Fans of Diz figure I’d get disfigured? Fuck you! This(dis) finger.
If y'all keep it a hundred, then it'll be a 3-0. That's six figures.
But since homie's a clown, I might throw my third round, ‘cause I want to sock ya.
So if I beat this pussy ass, 2-1, it's not a shocker.
I will bow, bow, Waka Flocka. Better call a doctor
when lick a shot in your noodle: penne a la vodka.
And when I'm done kicking your ass, we gon' kick it at Brass Rail.
There's a chick with a fat tail that be sending me fan mail.
Them hoes aren't playing. See everybody knows our name,
‘cause I be tossing paper like I'm trying to expose Arcane.
Alright so, you brought up the Math fight of course,
and I think it's awesome for you to reference,
and I think it's really awesome for you to mention.
No, honestly bro, thank you for putting your two cents in.
Are you sure it's not too expensive?
I know for you, being a Jew, that's kind of a huge investment.
You fucking chubby, chunky, southern, country, Humpty Dumpty
looking, fucking, ugly, musty, Dusty Rhodes, Tele-tubby,
Barney Rubble body double, Bubba Dudley cuddle buddy.
Fucking loser. This guy is like Allen Iverson:
He could've been the G.O.A.T. but he fucked up most of his chances,
and that's the difference between the Kobe's and the Jordan's and Magic’s,
the ones that stayed in the game, and gave you more and more classics,
and the ones that eventually fell off,
‘cause they always thought they were too good
to show up to court for their practice.
I know we appear like we're closely matched, but our roads don't overlap; when
I kept on moving forward and past ‘em,
you hit the fork in the road and went backwards.
We both started off as the total package,
and then you dipped into the lower bracket,
came back below the average of the normal standards;
all it took was a little four-year absence
and you became a former has-been like Toni Braxton.
You put in all this work to record these albums
that most fans in battle rap don't download no tracks from;
the other half don't even notice you enough to even know you had one.
This must be what it feels like to be Latoya Jackson.
Plus, I got another question I've been wanting to ask him:
Do you rap while you're doing home gymnastics?
Do you put your notepad down on your yoga mattress?
And you perform the dances like your multisyllabics,
how you cover the graphics so overdramatic,
like an HBO crime scene show reenactment.
Bro, you're a faggot.

Photo by Christian Andrabado for BattleRap.com.Doctors done fucked you up with a lot of medication, bro, and you got no more skill,
can't get back to his normal self ‘cause he don't even know how normal feel.
Quick, someone toss Jonah Hill another Soma pill so he can focus still,
‘cause he's looking real shaky on film like Cloverfield.
But anyways, how's that studio going though? You recording still? Bro, you're ill.
Still working towards that recording deal? You'll make it. I know you will.
‘Cause what you gon' do? Survive off your Fight Klub days?
Nobody even remembers those older rounds.
The only thing we remember from Fight Klub is, "Yo, hold it down! Hold it down!"
That's how annoying your fucking host would sound.
Or who else remembers his battles from the Hall of Fame?
When you went off the top with a dude with his top off;
who remembers Iron Solomon versus Flamez?
Yeah, he got the W right? But him in that battle and the holocaust were the same,
‘cause it wasn't no surprise to see the Jewish guy bodying(body in) Flamez.
Burn and you get burned in the game; burn, I'll burn you with flames.
Shit, even Bernie Sanders has the word "burn" in his name.
Now you're in a dead zone where no one enters. *Pop, pop* goes the heckler.
Go against me, and your physical form dismembered.
You won't be able to use your legs or arms again,
like Denzel Washington when he starred in the Bone Collector.
Your father built you an in-house studio
to record your records and get your stuff done,
but it's fucked up, ‘cause you can't have black people come over,
‘cause, "Son, we don't trust them."
Gets all awkward every time he has black folks recording over
and he comes into the room and confronts them
like, "Haha, so, Young Gunz. ..Where do you know my son from?"
All that matters when they view this back is who could rap,
so where are all my goons from Fallujah at?
In the streets letting bazooka's and Ruger's clap,
Uzi's, Mac's with the new attachments;
I got Halo from-the-future gats, huger straps than the one's Duke Nukem has.
*Boom, boom*, shoot ya ass, hadouken flash, *boom, boom, chilaka boom* ya ass.
I don't give a fuck. *Boom, boom*, North Korea nuclear blast,
I'll reduce you to ash with a nuke. A nuke and ash.
What's that? Dude, that's Nash, you stupid ass.
Yo, my resume is like a fucking cemetery, full of piles of humans stacked,
‘cause I done caught more overseas bodies than a Cuban raft.
If white boy got a nine, then he can get schooled with that,
get it? ‘Cause we're from two different schools; he a junior high school student.
I'm a fully developed uni-grad; I’m too advanced for you to grasp.
You Columbine popping nines; I'm a Virginia Tech going off on students campus,
which means me and you are not in the same shooting class.
You know what I'm saying, dog? Plus my newest strap
got a built in Mac computer that
keeps all of your vehicle movement's tracked like an Uber app,
could open up your location on Google Maps;
see you in the window, then I zoom in fast,
shoot your ass through the glass, spill your medulla on the Isuzu dash,
and the people that are moving past
will scream, "Help, someone just killed the fat kid from Superbad!"
And I don't give a fuck who you have.
Bring your goons for backup, then it's AngryFan movements: I'm only using caps.
I'll put you and all your fruity ass
dogs together in the same bag like a pack of Scooby Snacks.
And if you come back from the dead, I'ma put a giant round in the back of your head
like one of your stupid looking Jewish hats.
I'll body everything in the room, moving like I'm Supernat.
Leave me alone before I blow a fuse and snap, like a fuselage with a fuse attached.
You'll get your fucking right socket removed and snatched,
get your eyeball turned to a wounded gash.
The next interview you do with Vlad,
you'll be on the couch telling stories with one of your pupil's patched:
Slick Rick The Ruler's back.
When I say "Turn up,” I mean turn up to the max.
I mean turn him to a vegetable;
you seen the movie Expendables? Well I'll put you in a cast just has huge as that.
(Pussy. And you have pink eye.)
*clapping* Good for you, Diz. You got Pat Stay's formula down,
and your formula down.
I mean, you pack sixty seconds with enough bars for a four minute round,
and you make it work, it’s this crazy blur of rhyming schemes and hateful words
that you vomit out your mouth like you're trying to feed a baby bird.
At some point you got a diss line for me, or maybe Eurgh;
a crowd reaction distracts him, he shouts “faggot!” and a bunch of racial slurs,
just hoeing and yapping when he's supposed to be rapping.
Acting like you got ovaries and over reacting,
so we can just guess what's next, from slugfests to gun threats.
This chump went from throwing temper tantrums to throwing up(-)sets,
choked out Billy, now he feel he's a roughneck.
Been on 52 cards; got more attention from one deck.
Looking like a junky that don't have any drugs left,
you either need to catch up on rest or have a blood test,
‘cause the effects of crack and coke are what Dizaster don't consider.
You got deeper into some yay(‘ye) shit than Amber Rose's fingers.
If you see this addict twitching like he can't control his temper,
it's been half a minute since he had a chance to post on Twitter.
I mean, I'm just trying to diagnose all of this clown's symptoms.
Charron's autistic, but you've got I-Want-To-Be-Down Syndrome.
The type of lost nerd who wants to be hip hop so bad, just to fit in
he got the Microsoft Word graffiti font tattooed on his skin.
And what's under that mountain of ink, you need to talk about to a shrink,
but there's a lot smarter people in this crowd than you think.
We hear the contradictory shit out of your mouth when you speak,
how you call Pat Stay a racist, then call Dumbfoundead a chink.

Photo by Dan Gibs for KOTD.Told Hoffa, "stop eating fried chicken”. Har-dee-har.
That's as funny as the n-word with a hard E-R.
So go on and recite all them bars you can write bout the holocaust in one night,
call me a kike, and a bunch of shit I'm sure Caustic will like,
(Thanks for the heroin, dog.)
it's a strong strategy, Diz. Say it with audacity. Get loud, talk rapidly;
the crowd will all laugh at me,
but if that exposes the bigots, then I'll take the fall happily.
You think racism is hip hop? You buying the wrong rap CD’s.
Under our skin, we the same color. Don't believe it, then fight me.
Do it! You'll see you're just like me when you get beat to the white meat!
Or maybe Iron Sol' vers’ Iron Shiek is what all of you wanted,
Muhammad Ali versus Ali Muhammad.
Well that worked pretty well; I’ma make me some racist remarks now.
Your peoples eat pita, you were raised to be making these soft rounds.
We ate motza when we fled from Egypt, we went missing,
where the heat of the desert, where the stones were our best kitchen,
and the food’s hard texture stemmed from that existence.
What I'm saying is, going back generations, we bred(bread) different.
Our religious text gave us ambition; your clan's missing.
2000 years before Muslims, our Bible was handwritten.
Y'all changed Abraham to Ebrahim and ran with that transcription;
the Torah is the O.G., the Quran is just fan faction.
Boy, you done picked a bad Jew to attack.
You know how many MC's I ran through for a rack?
Your integrity's out of wack.
Look around the room, faces from everywhere on the map.
Our bond is rap; you should honor that,
but every card he act(cardiac) like he's serious as a heart attack,
but got to lean on shock value to bring a body back.
This preacher testifies just to keep you mesmerized;
you can't see through his disguise, need to reconnect your eyes.
I mean Jesus effing Christ, every freaking single rhyme
like a Lebaneser mime in, uh, Lethal Weapon 5,
and in your egotistic mind you believe in every lie,
so we may never get to see this style you beat to death just die.
Exposing D's deception gets him peeved in every line;
I'm making this pussy tight. This a kegel exercise.
See people recognize this Dizaster character’s not you.
You had a Halloween party where rappers battled in costume.
You made them stay in fake persona instead of going off real life,
so you won't have to be the only one who knows what that feels like.
See, he'll strike when he steps out of his lane and gets bold(bowled),
But you ain't really from the gutter, you just playing a role(roll).
So please, spare us. Spare us.
You ain't cooking coke; you ain't never seen the hood befo’.
You sweeter than a Tootsie Roll wrapped up in some cookie dough,
shoved inside a pussy hole of a virgin playing footsie toe.
Your Gjonaj battle is the only time you pushed an O.
And when you fucked up that jelly fish line, what Dizaster revealed up here
is what you mean to yell in your rhymes isn't actually real, it's clear.
See I'm a Man o’ War; when I'm on a sting, your death's been sealed.
My line's lead up to a body, I tend to kill(tentacle).
Yo, I flew here to get the mileage; you flew here to get demolished.
What they paid you pays your rent; I'm 'bout to put my kid through college.
If you take away the hype, all the hate and spite,
just to lose to Mook, they gave me twice what you got paid tonight.
My status may have fell, but when our checks coming through,
you'll see that even when I take an L, I get double you(W).
Yeah, I went over with Lyt, but tonight I'll respect time;
I said I'd kill you with three minutes, and we right at the deadline.
Now this guy.. really has pink eye.
Back off, ‘cause I don't want to be in front of you, you fricking disgrace.
You've already had it happen to you once,
don't make me rub some more shit in your face.
Here comes a guy whose career died a long time ago,
in the year 3 King of the Dot B.C., 500 Grind Time's ago,
comes a guy from the biased coast,
who's about to get all of his stripes revoked like Spider Loc.
See, you said this in one of the lines you wrote:
that the doctors prescribed you the same drugs as Michael.
Okay, that means you need all kinds of dope just so your fucking mind can cope,
so know, if you had the chance to be the straw that broke the camel's back,
you would use it to sniff a line of coke.
Ever since Mook, your career been on a declining slope.
It's like Gary Coleman's last episode alive; that’s a double meaning line:
if you take the name of his show, title and the way he died and combine them both,
then you finally know why this is his final Stroke.
Your fucking music career is one big giant Heimlich choke.
You should've known with an album like Monster you would wind up broke.
It's all in your bio; didn't see a single sell(cell) from it, or multiply in growth,
since your career was under the spotlight of the microscope.
What, do I gotta break it down in a science course or something?
Iron divides into four different types of isotopes,
which could explain why
you spent half of your life on the shelf trying to blow, but Iron won’t.
See a lot of elements become radio(-)active after their half-life, but Iron don’t,
which is why he's a normal Iron I suppose,
‘cause all the deals they had for him on the table folded,
and they never got Iron closed(clothes).
That's why you're hanging by a thread now, on life support.
You fucking got beat down in front of Mook until you couldn't fight no more,
which makes you the worst type of whore,
the one that gets fucked once and quits cause her vagina's sore.
You should fucking kill yourself. Plus, you violated as far as the guy code goes.
I provided you guided roads where ever your drive go; I gave you the Geico quotes.
The greatest of all time, the Michael Jordan of this entire sport,
a satanic shrine logo: I(eye) am the goat(G.O.A.T).
The messiah, the Eye of Horus, the Ayatollah to your diaspora,
I am your righteous Lord; I am your most high, like a white boy’s FICO score.
I am like Michael Koors,
‘cause I can catch a big bag and still have a lot of time in store,
Get it? A big bag and still have a lot of time in store?
I'll hit you with a thousand lines like a Miley Cyrus tour.
This is what Michael Moore would look like in his final form.
I know you gon' reference the five days in Egypt,
but trust me, this ain't that kind of war;
this is more like fighting Thor inside of a lightning storm.
I go Psycho Michael Myers with a knife inside a psych ward,
or cycle Slo-Niacin: good night you, bro.
I'll put you to sleep in your own language:
I'll “laila tov” you. Yeah, this Diet Rone is gonna die alone.
All it takes is one solid bar and he's a washed up body; punchlines are like Dial soap.
Dynamo. You trying to fight a robot cyborg from Biocorps;
we'll find you inside your home,
beside your phone, with your vital signs synchronized with the dial tone:
*bleeep*
Who gives a fuck if N.Y. is a no flying zone? I got Palestine inside my bones.
I'll hit you with a rock in your face from a couple kilometers away;
that's what I call reaching a milestone.
You will die from my pen stroke like Death Note, if it's written form we battle.
Freestyle, I'll son(sun) you off the top like solar panels,
and I got more examples.
No matter how many menorah lamps you have, you’ll never hold a candle
to the levels of pressure I was born to handle.
You know why? ‘Cause you don't have no souls or backbones.
Bro, you don't even know your past, bro.
Real Jews were Hebrews, black men who used to grow their afros.
You guys, are just a bunch of fucking random phony Polish assholes
who forged your passports, and don't have a land of your own,
so you come over and they jack yours,
but what is it all for? Is it drilling off shore? Is it the land, or do you want more?
See, Arabs, we’re peaceful, bro; you can come to my house.
I'd invite you in. Take the keys to my car, the garage door.
I just want you to feel comfortable at home,
since you're used to occupying households that are not yours.
I wasn't even supposed to be here today.
Organik was trying to get him and Hollow Da Don popping off.
They had an investor from his side ready to put up all the gwap;
made all these excuses at the end why it ended up falling off,
but the real reason we did not see(Nazi) it
is because Solomon's people couldn't afford what Hollow cost(holocaust).
I ain't anti-Semitic. Knock it off
before I go durka durka, allahu akbar on him and start letting rockets off,
dropping bombs and launching tomahawks.
I got a lot of fire bottled up like a walking Molotov.
I'm a blacksmith: I'll put an Iron bar on the chopping block.
I don't give a fuck if it's shalom shabbat or shabbat shalom,
I'll punch you in the face and leave your glasses broken on the floor; mazel tov.
You battled Mook on Smack and we watched you fall.
You let a mark(Marc) ass brother outshine you, take your spot; you Pau Gasol.
And that's when you got on some Bull shit and you dropped the ball.
Now everyone knows you was that one cat
with a giant pussy in his lap like Marley Marl.
This the army of God. Think the ending of every Inspector Gadget, ‘cause all you saw
was me putting a metal arm to this cat's head like Doctor Claw.
I know a little bit of Krav Maga.
Fucking twist your father into a arm bar, knock his fucking yamaka off.
Fuck it, if me and Iron brawl I'm knocking out anybody involved,
*boo boppity bow*, stand over your head like all of the stars.
I’m off the hook with these hands; people call me Kabal.
I’ll move at light speed as I proceed to break my right knee off in your jaw.
Fuck a gun bar. Fuck a gun bar. I'm creative; I don't need one at all.
I'll swing a fucking Pirates Of The Caribbean claw,
cut you in half with it like a seesaw, send the blade flying clean through the wall,
watch it come out the other side of the street
and kill five people that weren't even involved.
I'm like a evil Peter Parker that delivers people karma,
with a side order of beef kebab for starters.
Fucking with me’s retarded like asking Sweeney Todd to be your barber.
I'm a evil Tamil Tiger guerrilla fighter from Sri Lanka,
followed you to your job and I’m camped outside of your job
and I can't wait for you to leave the office like Stephen Harper.
Yeah. You think you can relate to Canadians more than me?
(Hahaha.) Bro, you are more pussy than a Weeknd concert.
Even the concept of you beating me here in Toronto couldn't be more farther
than the thought of Stevie Wonder being able to see his daughter.
I'll fucking let the Glock sleep him,
put him in an armbar ’til he stops breathing
like Eric Gardner when the cops beat him.
Pay attention, that's a double bar meaning.
I mean either way, you gon' die from arm squeezing.
They hated us ever since the World Trade got hit.
And they blamed us with all this bullshit, but what the media don't say is this.
How many of your people didn't show up to work that day
‘cause they claimed they were sick?
Or the Zionist banker who took out the insurance claim and then split?
Explain to me this: how a national tragic event could make your people rich,
or how a bunch of cavemen in Afghanistan
could penetrate the world's most sophisticated defense,
and have these monolithic beams that are encased in cement
all cut at the precise angle you need a buildings foundation to sit?
It's ‘cause you motherfuckers orchestrated the shit
and used the media as a tool to blame us swit wit—
To blame us swit wit? Or blame us with?
But it don't matter, because you blamed the desert for taking those plane flights,
but it's clear as daylight(Daylyt) that you staged that shit.
And you only have one ball. I mean, it's all good, bro.
Don't be mad ‘cause the doctor slashed your wontons and you can't get a hard-on.
You can still be the champ of any track you hop on, even with half your balls gone.
You could ask Lance Armstrong. You can still be successful; it doesn't change it all.
Look, you can ask Tom Brady, dog;
you can still make it in the game with a deflated ball.
I know, I know. I bet that little ball of his at night gets lonely.
Sitting in bed, he felt a trickle going down his leg slowly.
Thought he pissed on himself;
it turned out to be his right nut pouring out liquor for his dead homie.
(He has one fucking ball; he can't fuck with me.)

Photo by Zach Macphoto for KOTD.This is the path toward the end, so listen and pay attention,
’cause all your people ever did was scrutinize us.
My people are true survivors.
And you used the media as a way to oppress us,
and generation after generation you try to euthanize us,
then we turn into revolution fighters,
but what would you do if you was in the street seeing them kill women
and execute their minors?
Shooting your child in his back,
how could you justify seeing a two year old
with a tank on his back like a scuba diver?
*Spits, arabic word, spits*
Who grew Al Qaeda? You grew Al Qaeda. You guys are fueling ISIS.
This ain't no war on terrorism; this is a Zionist Jewish crisis,
a bunch of fucking greedy bankers who have no value for what human life is.
If you ever see an Arab group of snipers,
just know that's from weapons that you provide us,
so we can kill each other and you can use it as an excuse to crucify us,
but not now, not now. I'ma flip out. Bro, who defines us? Who's the finest?
What am I doing? I'm losing my mind, bitch.
Give me this shit, al these fools should like this.
I don't give a fuck what I'm gonna do, ‘cause this dude's the nicest.
(*Puts on a Hitler moustache and starting rapping in fake German*)
Hooten feinstich, hooten feinstich.
Fuck it, it dropped off and a fusten tagen,
Barbra Streisand und foosten tragen.
Roosten tagen a roost a da hoosten dragen,
Seth Rogan ... Adam Sandler … Shia Labeouf … roosten tagen.
(*Then spits a few bars in Lebanese. Translation courtesy of our Arabic-speaking friends; if we've messed anything up, please let us know in the comments.*)
"Who do you (Jews) think you are?
You're full of yourselves because America defends you,
but you keep attacking the Palestinians because they have no one to defend them
but Hezbollah, and you stay really far from them,
because every time you get near Hezbollah you get fucked up.
I'll fuck your mother, you son of a bitch. Suck a dick.
Fuck all your people and the people that birthed your God."
So, y'all wanna know the real reason that we had problems in Grind Time?
It w-it was- uh.. shit, me too. Might've been all in this guy's mind.
I mean, when I picture what was at stake and follow the timeline,
D was only beefing because I was in my prime,
‘cause we had never met before. They had rappers on every floor,
and you paid Kap Kallous to book my room next to yours.
Since you don't know the difference between real life and a messageboard,
you trolled the hallway all day posted up on my bedroom door.
The whole weekend you followed me, no drama or static,
then hopped on camera in your battle, and you called me a faggot,
and I'll never forget this, with Pumpkinhead as my witness,
you ran right out of the ring to me and begged for forgiveness.
It was awkward, and kind of just weird,
offered to buy me a beer, talking right in my ear,
apologizing for years about a line that Bashir
took time to prepare that I didn't hear,
‘cause I wasn't watching your battle, ‘cause I didn't care.
See, between love and hate, there's a thin line, but for Diz, no disconnect.
So everybody that Diz respects becomes someone he disrespects,
from the indirects to the blatant hate. In your Twitter rants you’ve discussed me,
but you're on my dick the second we're face to face,
trying to give me dap. You disgust me.
With your rants and your ten page speeches,
talking junk about Smack more than an N.A. meeting.
If you and URL's relationships something you can't repair,
you know what a real gangster would do? Just not battle there.
(What's wrong with King Of The Dot? You know what I'm saying?)
You hate the east coast ‘cause we never gave you support?
We gave you hip hop culture, Diz; we gave you this sport.
The way that you walk, your dress code, the slang that you talk.
You from the Fresh Coast? Son, the word "fresh" came from New York.
You pull your iPhone out your pocket in battles; awesome example
of how all of the raps that you spit, you got from the Apple.
Y'all know his note section’s just a pad full of writtens.
So what, it's cool to do that now, ‘cause Canibus did it?
You such a hip hop purist, how's that such a crutch you still rely on?
We seen Diz cell out in battles more than Malathion.
You call street rappers phone(-)y but your gun bars be dialed out;
it's like you can't get a line out without a nine now.
The principles he been talking, we don't ever see him walking.
It's all theory; you don't really stand for shit: you Stephen Hawking.
It's so feeble. Flint, Michigan tap water: your flow's lethal,
but only because the poison you fed 'em misled your own people.
You're not a terrorist; you're a tourist, a gimmick,
pointing your fingers at our flaws like a critic to hide your fraudulent image.
The real perpetrator's you, but you don't want to admit it;
you're like the coward who killed Cyrus and said The Warriors did it.
Oh, you.. fucking.. hypocrite. You whore for attention. You exhibitionist.
You preach, but you don't practice, give a speech and contradict the shit.
Overdoser, coke in the nose, emotional roller coaster,
you opportunist, you Brutus, Judas you culture vulture!
I hate you. I hate you, but it's my fault,
‘cause I stepped out of this ring, and turned my queen to my ex wifey,
and I prayed her new suitor would be a king who was just like me.
I walked away from this woman who was the love of my life,
and I can't stand that her new man just ain’t fucking her right.
See, when you was still trying to steer through the bottom tier,
and the future of battle rap was not as clear, I was here.
Been a pioneer the entirety of my career.
I made this backpack shit take off: I'm the Rocketeer.
I spelled out this path to give y'all some direction,
put myself on the map, so you could follow the legend.
What I deserve I achieve, with just a verse and a beat.
I didn't work for a fee and what I earned wasn't free.
Went on a murdering spree, hit every curb in the street,
when it was 30 degrees I was still burning MC’s.
In terms of this league, my words and my schemes are the birds and the bees;
the sperm and the seeds, what emerged was this league.
So you're the MC you are because you were birthed from my breed.
I didn't quit and come back; I took paternity leave.
I fathered your whole existence, Diz. You learned this from me,
then played the role of an heir you're unworthy to be.
You're not Solomon reborn. You've been keeping my seat warm,
a dis(Diz)figured version of me that's how D formed(deformed),
and the Commodore and Eli might seem like a lovely option,
’til you realize, in real life what it feels like without Nucky Thompson.
Let Diz, Pat and Mac scrap for seconds and thirds.
Who gives a fuck about runners up now that the best has returned?
My last battle was a classic. Now Don't Flop has thrown me in the fucking ditch,
‘cause I don't wanna seem sexist, yet he's only given me another bitch.
(Nothing? Fine.)
Fuck you, Mister Grist! I don't like your lessons no more.
All you talk about is how my attendance is poor,
and you've been on my case more so than ever before,
so I'll give you a left to the jaw if you ever report whatever you saw,
and if I get expelled, be assured that you're getting some more.
You see Mixy as your companion, and you think that he's your buddy,
‘cause you've both got master’s degrees in dick-related studies,
and, yeah, you might have good holidays and be swimming in the money,
but with all that marking you have to do, I bet you wish you was a dummy.
(Mark-ing, you know?)
But hold up, Mixy, I'm taking the mick, see?
You could mix E in my drink and still could never lick me.
I'll make Mix see that the dead poets are history;
I’m like the tenth Olympian, and you're a motherfucking pixie.
When punchlines hit Mark Grist, I know they will mark Grist;
your name is a grain, so of course I'll tear apart Grist.
And I don't care about Dead Poets’ dead poetry;
after this you'll be a corpse under a dead poet tree.

I'm always on the ball; I should be back-heeling.
I won't stop rapping ’til my hands peeling,
and this guy gets sacked for his bad teaching.
If I get gully, you'll feel a pain in your back region;
smashed glass, pain in your back region,
then you'll know what it's like to be on the wrong side of a glass ceiling.
I heard teacher versus student battle, and I wasn't going to class;
I get to battle that nerdy bastard who failed at controlling the class.
You knob-head, I hope you drop dead.
If I punch you in the face, who are you gonna call, Ofsted?
To those at home who are sitting, watching YouTube, don't start clicking;
I know this might look like some kind of extreme babysitting.
It's actually a rap battle, two grown men lyrically bitching,
just one of us isn't legally old enough to drink inside the building.
And now, Bradley's gonna try and act less infantile,
by pretending that he's proper riled,
so sit back, watch him reconcile with his lack of breastfeeding as a child.
That's why this ugly duckling’s suckling from the teat of any bumpkin
with a beat; all means of dumping his meaningless shit on something.
And the speed of words you're mumbling hides the fact they don't mean nothing.
He may have beat the witch from Oz, but it's time for me to teach this Munchkin.
You will never amount to somebody, and I'm here to raise a grievance.
“Big up everyone whose parents have property in Manchester,”
mate, that's not a fucking achievement.
This Blizzard lizard's got no fire; it's just hot air he's breathing.
When all's said and done, as the years drag on,
you'll look even more like Deborah Meaden.
This rapper's pint-sized; he's cock-eyed.
When he raps, his mouth only actually moves on one side.
He's like a pre-pubescent Popeye,
complete with physique that implies that all the spinach in the world has died.
And look at him try, this poor little chap, like so many anemics I've seen in my class,
dreams of riding up high on a unicorn's back,
while defending the world from an Orcish attack.
You wank off in sandals
to pictures of Gandalf you stack with the mags in your porn stash.
He's got a hard-on for wizards; he only called himself Blizzard
‘cause that's the company that made World of Warcraft.
Every bar you've ever spat was a sack of pig shit.
They say that words are weapons; then you must be pacifistic.
I've hated you since the day I first heard you; I was antagonistic,
and this next round is gonna be fucking painful like it's masochistic.
It doesn't take much for me to tell you that you're lame.
That's why you've gotta(got a) die like a board game.
You're trying to act like you're the boss of Don't Flop, like you're Rowan,
acting like you're all-seeing and all-knowing,
but you're in a canoe with no paddles, bitch; it looks like you're rowing,
and I'm gonna get rid of Mark like when Germany brought the Euro in.
(I'll come back to you in a sec, yeah? Don't worry, man.)
Fuck anyone that said my battle with H-Bomb was a stroke of luck.
I just hated being a laughing stock, now I couldn't give a sugar-coated fuck.
I'm feeling drunk off disrespect now, and I've got no plans to sober up.
The same guys that sent me death threats now want to hold my nuts.
The battlers that name-dropped me? I'm scaring ‘em with ease.
I'm an embarrassing pain to them like a venereal disease.
So bring up all your fiction, man, I dare you, do it, please,
‘cause you only talk gas, Mark, on various degrees.
So wave to the camera; you haven't got any hope.
You might as well look up to the sky and ask God for the rope.
It's like I'm looking at JFK's head from an optical scope:
you're the dead president, and I won't stop til you slope.
This battle journey's been insane. Peace, Eurgh, it's still taking me on a trek,
yet this guy's music couldn't even feed him a cheque,
so escape the premises, bitch; you better leave in a sec
before I turn your little classroom into Peterborough Tech.
Bradley's last battle showcased his innate ability to hurl abuse at women,
and it was so impressive, that I thought that I might mimic him.
A funny thing, online you whinge that your Mum saw your last battle accidentally?
Well I hate to chat crap behind anyone's back, so why not address her directly?
Mrs. Green, Mrs. Green, please move into the screen;
I’ve got some people behind me I'm sure that you've seen.
Gentlemen, say hello to Mrs. Green.
You may not believe me, but you've actually met most of them;
I mean there wasn't much light; you were at a lower height,
kinda slobbering like a doberman.
Those nights out gathering STD’s, while Bradley stayed in collecting Pokemon,
and you beat him by a landslide, ‘cause he only collected most of them.
Mrs. Green, Mrs. Green,
that froth from between your maw’s jaws
dribbles more than an entire football team.
When you sit down, it sounds like a sea lion applauding.
Not many women insert a life-jacket before a young man comes a-boarding.
Every morning, noon and night, those juices they are pouring
’til your thighs, when spread wide, resemble laminate flooring.

Mrs. Green, Mrs. Green, your son's thoughts are obscene;
the truth is you live in his every wet dream.
A seventeen-year-old Oedipus, he fantasizes about each of us,
climaxing more heavily upon you than an Eastenders omnibus.
That's why I'm here to stop this depravity,
point out how wrong it is, the seriousness, the gravity,
explain that more rubber gets burned in your vaginal cavity
than the combined alacrity of every Formula One engine battery.
I'm so sorry about about you, Mrs. Green, and I'm so sorry about Bradley;
I'm doing my best to help him, but he just keeps on trying to attack me.
I'd be pretty pissed off, but he's doing it really fucking badly.
I didn't come here for my assessments, Mister Grist;
I came for my rapping endeavors,
so don't you dare think of correcting my grammatical errors.
And we know now you're a teacher, so that needs no further explanation,
but I'm smarter than you think, let me recap on my education.
In Nursery, I was a terror; I made everyone's experience hell.
The only noise that I enjoyed hearing: the bell.
Temper tantrums every day; I used to walk out of the room.
Thirteen years later, I'm here making mountains of moves.
I'm seventeen, education has took up seventy-five percent of my life,
and I hated every second of it. What, you expect me to lie?
I dropped out of college ‘cause I hated that negative vibe,
and it was teachers like you that made me feel aggressive inside.
You're not superior; we're the reason you get the pay that you do,
and if your pass rate is too low, the government are going to take it from you.
This is like Lunar C's SBTV, and you can't say it ain't true;
this is Blizzard vers’ shit teacher, but I get to say it to you.
My scriptures make Samuel Peeps look like any old man in the street,
make Martin Luther want to write another draft of his speech,
make the likes of Oscar Wilde and Confucius sit back and retreat.
Basically, I'm in a class even this man couldn't teach.
I'm pissed off at the haters; other rappers come off kinda sour.
I hate the school system and I'll never plead to a higher power.
You're just a tiny flower that I'll devour with a violent shower,
so fuck you, your campus, your lesson plan, and your £8.95 an hour.

I suggest that you fuck off, and play some Beyblade
before I slap you with an F grade,
or at least go jack off to some vampires like the rest of your age range.
He's trying to act tougher than me, but I suspect he might be nerdier.
You're about as intimidating as your city, and you're only slightly wordier.
I don't care about the aggressive shit you spit online or that everybody's heard of ya;
you'd still give yourself a hernia trying to assemble flat-pack furniture.
“But I keep dissing him for being a teacher, what have I gotta say so I can shock ya?”
The honest truth is, Bradley, I've been served better whilst in Costa.
I consider it a crime how much time you spend rhyming
about the rest of the Don't Flop opera;
it's a solo gun fight, not some homo-erotic spaghetti opera.
And in Bradley's last battle, he wasn't dreadful,
which means many doubt he even wrote it;
see this young Green plants himself with better rappers,
hopes to get it through osmosis.
The best of ventriloquist dummies; his ass can take on both fists,
then he rides them in so deep as he appears to be riding on their shoulders.
I don't have to write like Socrates to expose your mediocrity,
and considering the pics of the last battle I've seen,
I'm surprised you're not trying to get off with me.
Honestly, Bradley, besides getting date-raped by Australian women
and saying words a little bit quickly, I'm not quite sure what you actually do.
Plus, it's a sad fact that half your iPhone apps are actually older than you.
I'm not gonna deny that after his last battle his reputation grew,
but, if I'm being honest,
I'm gonna have to write, “has to improve” upon this term's review.
I have orchestrated this beautifully, like I was intricate on strings with it.
Co-Rone-ation day, from my Simba shit to the king of this.
Today I think like a king; it’s in my bones, in my speech.
Today I eat like a king; I’m thinking bon appetit.
It’s been six months. What glory did you bring home to the league?
You ain’t even seize the throne; that crown was thrown at your feet.
What is the title to you? Oh, what, now you’re a star?
No, you’re still broke. Bummy. Scrounging for rounds at the bar,
so I consider the term “title” not sounding so hard
when you’ll never have a title on a house or a car.
See, you never rap enough piff to pack up the joint,
and so they made a call to Rone(Calderon) to back up the point.
We could battle for one hour. We could do a one-rounder.
You lost the title after one match; that’s a short reign(rain) like a sun shower.
You think like such a pussy whenever you make a verse.
You’re so scared of what someone else might say, so you try to say it first.
Photo by Christian Andrabado for BattleRap.com.Well I predict that you’ll predict what I do in this match.
And you’ll get done like the last prophet(Prophit) that I threw in the trash.
Boy thinks that he’s a psychic, but no one here’s believing him.
It’s funny he’s an extra small but he thinks that he’s a medium.
But this pussy smells fishy. Is that salmon or albacore?
Is he mackerel or just gutted? He can’t get a call back from Macklemore.
Bitch all my dogs loyal, like DJ Khaled or a labrador;
I’m in El Salvador, dodging bullshit off the cape just like a matador.
Bitch, I’m just getting started; this is salad course.
You’re mad trash like a bag full of apple cores.
Oh he ain’t catch it? Who the fuck he, Nelson Agholor?
If he the plug, I’ll rip him out by the power cord.
You think you could rap, but my flow’s so disgusting.
Stumpman, stumpman, stumpman, you like five foot nothing.
Since I brought my boys here I think I might jump him; no.
Since he this tall, damn, I think that I could jump him; whoa.
You live off apology checks you get ‘cause you’re a eighth Native American.
That means we’re paying you
to shut the fuck up and not complain ‘bout your heritage.
And that’s the only checks you get, the only income that you draw,
so if my people hadn’t killed your people, you would get no money at all.
I mean, no hood booger want to boogie with you.
No neighbor got any sugar to use.
I mean, Saurus gets ten million times more pussy than you,
and look at the dude.
And I bet those walls in the friend zone steep.
Twin bitches suck a nut for a Benzo each.
You a snitch and a broke little S.O.B.
I bet the pink slip on any car that Greg Poe lease.
Wait. Any bar that Ill conceived is ill-conceived.
It’s no illusion; Ill losing. This the guillotine.
It’s incredible; I’m what makes Ill edge-able,
the fact that he can’t read me. I feel like like I’m illegible,
but, you bragging ‘bout smoking weed in Oregon. I said that isn’t even Ill, is it?
Wait, smoking weed in Oregon; that isn’t even illicit.
Boy, I pass models coke on glass-bottom boats.
This some sacrificial slaughter. It’s the lamb vers’ the GOAT.
And I get he’s your bro and that you think that he’s dope,
but do me a favor: get Bigg K’s dick out your throat.
I mean, in the Caustic battle, you have his whole D in your mouthpiece.
You all over Kenny’s nuts like Stevie Janowski.
You taking trips, I make your bitch sit and leave me a house key,
then come piss on the rug like the scene from Lebowski.
World Dom One, we were faded off Canadian liquor.
Saurus had a bitch in his room; trying to say he could hit her,
but he declined, when he ain’t even have to pay for the stripper,
so for thinking Ill is straight(illustrate), well, what, I got to paint you a picture?
World Dom Two, you blackout wrestled Dirtbag Dan.
The full story is that Dirt merked that man.
At the hotel that night, he choked you out twice.
I’m used to your rounds putting me to sleep. Well now you know what that’s like.
Check, Illmac tried to rush him, right? Dan got him mummified.
He couldn’t have put you to sleep faster with warm milk and a lullaby.
So talk shit when I’m passing by you and it’s not a thing to pacify you,
and if you sleep on any of my shit tonight, then I’m looking for Dan behind you.
He mentioned my homie from Seattle, which reminds me,
there’s just something wrong about you,
to the point Macklemore might make a song about you.
I mean, I’ll show you how to deliver the frees and get sick in the ring;
he said TheSaurus gets more pussy and he might be spitting the frees,
but that’s fitting. You know why that that’s fitting to me?
‘Cause you’re getting loose,
and this is the biggest pussy that’s every been given to me.
All right, look. Straight to it. I been the champ, before the title or trophy.
Get your wifey to blow me, but I don’t chase birds; that’s for Wile E. Coyote.
My fam is full of animals like I was Mowgli.
They won’t be happy ’til his head in a box: (Bing,) smiley emoji.
Get socked in the ring, like I’m Mick Foley minus the goatee.
You’d get ate(eight) with a twenty-four, but I’m retiring Roney
with a seasoned sixteen; shit remind me of Kobe.
I don’t play in the ring. Yo, you got no bars, like a parolee.
You got no bars, like a parolee.
I said it twice; that’s okay, ‘cause I guaranteed to pepper Roney.
Hold up. No bars, like a parolee. It doesn’t matter; you know why?
I’ll get a body out of nowhere like Kylie and Khloe.
Grimey. I’ll treat Roney like a entree served warm,
and never fight clean. I was always dirt poor.
I rep the North West like Kanye’s first-born.
You couldn’t ride the wave with Beyonce’s surfboard.
Surfboard.. Roney’s music? Nerdcore.
You are a joke. This motherfucker is a shtick.
Him and his friends get together and punch each other in the dick.
You are a clown. I guess college life made them closer;
they’re like, “party’s on, bro.” Invite some ladies over,
but don’t pass out. These guys could play the joker.
They shave each other’s eyebrows and draw dicks on their faces..
while they’re wide awake and sober.
You are a cornball. You’re battle rap for teeny boppers. Expose the gimmicks.
Wave riders: motion sickness.
I mean, we might be close in pigment, but the approach is different.
You, “white kid raps fast”, Mac Lethal, all viral. So suspicious.
I mean, why? Old traditions? Wholesome image?
It’s simple; you’re a symbol of their own existence. Clothes and skin, shit,
they look at you, see a mirror. Don’t even know the difference.
Just can’t get Past his Presence. Oh. So simplistic.
They think he’s the Future ‘cause he reflects their lives like the Ghosts of Christmas.
You’re battle rap for dummies, for the casual fan.
Get rocked; whip him with my spatula hand since he a flash in the pan.
That’s just the tip of the iceberg; the Titanic get slammed.
Put us in the same boat, I’ll split you like a catamaran.
If my name’s at stake(steak), I got cattle to brand.
Bitch, I’m a legend, and I still(steel) open doors, like a battering ram.
You a virus; I’ll penicillin ya.
There’s never been a ceiling to my writing so my pen is sealing ya.
Spiteful. I bet it’s killing ya. Thirsty. Riding on genitalia.
Such a desperate for attention whore, where he’s from is a metaphor.
Be mindful, his city’s telling ya.
He’d probably swap AIDS with Tom Hanks just to go viral in Philadelphia.
See, you’re just here to entertain, so you’re feeling like the cash crop,
but that little bit of fame dries up when the laughs stop,
so you can have them views, ‘cause I’ll be here when your fans not.
I’ll hold down the champ slot. He can be the mascot.
You said I could be the mascot, but no one believes you.
If it wasn’t for the stage, no one could see you.
But, I’ve battled fat rappers. I’ve battled short rappers.
I’ve battled gun rappers, but never sword rappers.
He doesn’t rap about guns ‘cause they’re not realistic.
He’ll rap about dragons that fight with Aladdin, but it comes to ‘matics
and he’ll be like eh-eh.
He’ll rap about Frodo and all-seeing logo, but it comes to fo’-fo’s
and he’ll be like no, no.
Well what you got, the Yoroitoshi or the bolo on ya?
You got the viking, or the bowie, or the old katana?
I’m in the cuts just laughing at the blade at your side.
Rocking stilettos, you’ve been giving off a rapier vibe,
like it’s a game in your mind, trying to perpetuate that thug life.
He holds his blade like a mic, screaming, “All I need is one knife.”
That shit isn’t cut right. That shit shows your blood type.
There’s a name for that: bringing a knife to a gun fight.
I mean, you rap of the corniest shit:
“I’ll take the hammer of Thor off Orion’s belt.
If I stared at Medusa, her eyes would melt.”
Shut the fuck up.
That shit’s your only angle, so you don’t want to tangle.
If the Illuminati are what’s keeping your music off the radio,
we owe them a “thank you”.
See I could coach him, like Cus D’Amato, with details like custom autos.
You think that it’s just bravado? I done this(Dundas) like West Toronto.
You playing yourself on stage just like he John Leguizamo.
So fuck Hitori Hanzo; I’ll turn Greg into Greg Giraldo.
Bro, you look like Wee Man with a cheap tan and no bread.
If you’re ever kicking yourself, it’s probably in your own head.
His name is Greg Poe but it should be Po’ Greg
‘cause I’d be your size if I had no legs.
A paper cut could lay him up under a surgical lampshade.
Then we could cover your whole body with one vertical band-aid.
I will give your fam shells like I’m serving a clam bake,
then I’ll break down a pound like I’m learning a handshake.
What you know about talking about fake drug shit to fit in?
You can’t argue with that.
Fucking selling edibles out in Oregon, well you started with snacks.
On that white in New York, you want to party with Smack;
whenever sonny(Sunny) In Philadelphia then it’s(Dennis) Charlie with Mac.
But who getting Jobs in the Apple out of Mac and Tosh(MacIntosh)?
And if you can’t get booked there, you can’t get looked at one of the battle gods.
He break the law in front of some cops out in Brooklyn for sport,
just so he could say that he got booked in New York.
Fuck if you pray to the West; you look like prey to the East,
and so it’s asalamalakum, then I’m making him sleep.
I feel like Kanye if it came to the beef,
‘cause I’d throw 500 on a fade every day of the week.
Oh, you got locked up? Well it doesn’t count if you were trying to get caught,
buying drugs, shining your watch in the eyes of the cops.
Like, “Please, at least slam me down or pull me out of traffic, pal,
or at least get me patted down, so I have something to rap about.”
You the dude at the DUI checkpoint like, “I know my rights.”
As he’s riding home at night down the road on a stolen bike.
Talking ‘bout, diamonds are evil and jewelry is opulent,
’til you got your first chain and you couldn’t stop rocking it.
You think you got it figured out about anything ornate.
You think expensive clothes exemplify poor taste.
You trying to justify the salad that’s sitting on your plate,
acting like meat is murder ‘cause you can’t afford steak.
What look, outside of battling, did Illmaculate get?
You turn your opportunities into nothing, and that’s sad as a bitch,
and now you couldn’t even leave if we asked you to quit.
It’s like you’re holding onto battling like it’s the only thing you have, ‘cause it is.
This body’s about be a classic in this bitch.
He brought up the Hitori Hanzo blade, like that shit was a myth.
..I think Rone thinks that he’s actually a prince.
I’m confused, Rone, ‘cause you talk like man, but you act like bitch.
I mean, you look like Rone, but you rap like Twist.
I drank with Norm Kelly. We toast a glass like this;
said “Cheers”, and told Norm I got his back like Cliff.
You called him a bitch, sounding a bit jelly.
But who’s the mayor of Philly? Go ‘head, bitch, tell me.
No? No? Cool, ‘cause Norm ‘ll beat the shit out of Jim Kenny
and run him out of Philly quicker than Chip Kelly.
Photo by Zach Macphoto.You battled DNA. Day of the event, here’s an angle he ‘a pick:
he said black rappers don’t raise their kids. You a racist piece of shit.
If that’s who you want as champ, you can get AIDS and eat a dick,
‘cause that shit ain’t acceptable on any stage or league you with.
For real, that’s the reason some fans don’t care KOTD exists.
First you gay this week, then switch.
You’re cornier than the day Charron claimed that he’s a crip.
You should be put in your place and make good on your statements,
but he ran track at Penn State, so he’s always been good with the races.
I heard he was getting roasted on the messageboard
after blogging throwing a tantrum on the tennis court,
which I thought was the perfect metaphor:
you know, him getting served over the net when he could’ve been a better sport?
It’s perfect, ‘cause in that blog,
he said I was the benefactor of the system, that’s why I get more credit,
while blogging from all-white facility for indoor tennis.
(You don’t see the— all right.)
Benefactor of what, Rone? It’s been a long road, chockfull of potholes.
I lost a match in the ring, I was Jack with the beans;
I aimed high ’til my stock(stalk) rose.
Stockholm. Yeah, the fans can be hot-cold,
but mono e mono I’ll cook you like pot roast on a hot stove,
or waffles at Roscoe’s. You a snot-nose;
but I wrote is (sniff) El Chapo to nostrils.
So don’t reach; that’s a Dot role.
Don’t Flop; you a lost Soul.
Dude is silly; you from Philly? I’m Ali when he boxed Joe.
Get it? You boxed, Rone. You’re John Doe; you’re spot’s blown like a foxhole.
You’re not dope; you’re not Diz; he’s not me; he’s not grown.
And we all know that I’m 5’4”,
but if I roll to Rone’s crib then Rone’s getting 5-0’ed;
in three rounds you’re getting five-o’ed. You rap fast; you could die slow.
Toronto, this is not close.
He’s Tosh hosting a talk show; I mean he’s got jokes,
but what I’ve written will inspire ambition in a writer(Rida),
a combo of Pac’s ghost, Hollow and Pablo Picasso in God mode.
Bruh, even you admit you’re corny. It’s just sad that your fans can’t.
Spoiled brat. His parents paid for rap camp and half the sales on Bandcamp.
He just wants what he can’t have, so he wrote until his hands cramped,
then got the chain as a lower back tat. Know what he calls it? His champ stamp.
But he’s soon to be the king. Soon to be the k— that’s how they brand you,
cool. I got the King, helpless. Think, Elvis.
Watch where this fall from grace lands(Graceland) you.
Malpractice: boy, I’m out of patience(patients) and such.
Soon to be the— man, that obnoxious phrase is a crutch.
Got ‘em calling you “king” for no reason: conversations with Lux.
(Look at me, kid. Oh, he gon get this work.)
See, his whole persona is “look at me, look at me,” so proud of his fame.
They should call you team mascot when announcing your name.
You know why? He puts on this character to keep the crowd entertained,
then pulls a couple stunts,
’til a real player comes and you get taken out of the game.
What’s the point of going out on a tour
when there’s no one in the crowd when you clowns go perform?
You’re so deep in the game, still sleeping down on the floor.
You act proud, but it rots you right down to your core,
so, to say I fuck with you? Well I doubt it for sure;
renowned or obscure, I never heard a sound you recorded,
bitch, you’ve been making music since 2004
and I still haven’t listened to one album of yours.
And the fans of your rap music are white as a Klan unit.
I’m trying to make him embrace it, but damn it, he can’t do it.
He should be grassroot-ing, but instead he pack-mule-ing,
‘lac cruising, gat shooting, back of the tan Buick,
said you had nicks(Knicks) for starters, like Al Houston and Pat Ewing.
What’s next, you making gram movements like Fat Jewish?
Well, that lightweight angle is shaky as Shaq shooting,
and that’s stupid as Atlanta fans rooting for Cam Newton.
Boy, you said your dream battle’s Jin. I couldn’t give a shit less.
It’s funny a little Asian kid couldn’t make you a success(6s).
It’s a vignette on forgotten skill and a prequel to popping pills;
it’s sick how you think you’re sick. How the mighty have fallen(,) Ill.
Bro. Pat Stay’s first was all short jokes to put this herb down,
so for me to try any of that shit would be retarded.
But I gave Pat Stay every short joke he used in his first round,
so I was up one nothing before this battle even started.
I don’t have short jokes; I don’t have short facts.
I don’t have short quotes; I just have short math.
Lookism. A guy who’s 5’6” has to make $183,000 a year
more than someone who is 6’ to be deemed equally attractive.
That’s $24,000 an inch. That’s the fraction we’ll use,
and what I did is I took my height and subtract it from dude’s.
So look at you, 5’5”, but that’s adding a few;
so Google me. 6’1 and a half or 6’2”.
Before this battle even starts, by all the math that I do,
I’m already a quarter million dollars more attractive than you.
And there’s nothing you can do about it. You know that it’s unfair.
You could be Brad Pitt in the face and no woman would care.
I mean, there’s height restrictions in the military. I don’t know why; it’s disgusting,
but of course you hate the government. You’re too short to die for your country.
So that explains his head condition,
his conspiracies, his pessimism.
Another adolescent victim, short, poor, expecting visits
from a daddy who’d never swing it, so rage done festered in him
and he turned it against the system,
but being short is no excuse for being a mental midget.
I mean, you hate yourself for being short. I can tell it through your face.
But look on the bright side; there’s less of you hate.
And losses are a positive, so you should see some growth from this,
but the fact is, you’re 5’3” and you just can’t get over it.
He’s jealous I call myself the Prince, like that should describe you.
Well, maybe you’re right, too, ‘cause you and Prince are both 5’2”.
I call myself the Prince as a Symbol, that I’m forging my own path.
I call myself the Prince ‘cause it will always be something I was formerly known as.
Like: 2056, in a nursing home. T-Rex’s granddaughter is nursing holmes.
Brittle bones, decrepit clothes, shoes too big for your feet,
‘cause after all the years of gravity, he’s shrunken to 4’3”.
He’s past the whole rapping thing. Now he’s battling for his sanity.
Dementia and Alzheimer’s; he can’t recognize his own family,
so they don’t visit. He’s so lonely; his incontinent useless ass.
Well one of the nurses, somehow, hears that he used to rap,
so as a birthday present, she decides to drag a classic out.
Gets all the invalids, the old people, and has them gather ‘round.
She says it’s Illmac versus Rone, but then he panics at the sound,
‘cause as soon as he hears my name, then he flashes back to now,
and suddenly, he’s wishing for his casket and his death.
Suddenly, he’s short of air and he’s grabbing for his neck,
and if that was then and this is now, and you’re still panicking through sweat,
then imagine just how bad it was at the actual event.
He keeps bringing up conspiracies, and half of you laugh.
Well, I must be a conspiracy theorist; that’s actually facts.
Shit, I feel like B.O.B. with what Adam just rapped,
‘cause I swear that entire round was actually flat.
As a matter fact, you talking ‘bout my drugs, when I got caught for the case.
He didn’t mention my P’s, did he(Diddy)?
I mean that’d be perfect, ‘cause his most-reacted line is when he remixed me.
(P Diddy - Remix me? Fuck all that.)
What you looking at? You are not a man. You will never be a man.
You know why? He let Pat palm the back of his head with his hand.
Never mind Sandusky molesting this bitch.
YouTube “getting brains in the lac”. I didn’t edit this shit.
It’s a video of you giving Pat head in the whip.
You don’t remember the clip? You didn’t think I would mention this shit?
Pat looked like MadChild last Blackout:
a Swollen Member getting neck while he’s stiff.
The video starts, Pat getting head in the car. Nothing too embarrassing in it,
’til it’s revealed it’s not a girl, it’s you. Genius. Being gay is hilarious. Get it?
(No? Me either.)
Tell me this: what was the moment you became aware they were taping there?
Was it when Pat came, you came up for air, wiped your facial hair
after treating Pat’s dick like you was ‘bout to find the chain in there?
I guess we just from two different scenes,
‘cause I ain’t trying to get on YouTube and Watch(-)men do shit obscene.
You normally play the Comedian, but in that new clip I seen,
you just went Dr. Manhattan on us: just blew(blue) dick on screen.
Hey, fuck it though. You should get a letterman jacket for pleasuring Pat.
Giving head in the ‘lac. Yo, I guess when he lettered in track
ain’t the only time he’s ever been a(-)head in a lap.
We both battled Pat. Look how we related to him.
I left with Pat’s head. You gave it to him.
How did that relationship start? Does he think that it’s fate as well?
Or did you just slide in his DMs like, “A/S/L”?
That shit’s gay as hell, and you taped it. Well,
I don’t care he made it, he’s Larry David: he played himself.
You know what? You’re the most disrespected battler. Pesci ain’t got shit on you.
Daylyt left the stage and dipped on you. Pat Stay put his dick on you.
Diz made you dress up as Bruce Jenner and put a wig on you.
Now, I’m ‘bout to wig on you.
The judge decide the outcome, think Pimp a Butterfly album:
I got schitz(skits) on you.
Slap that Roney Baby the Prince off you;
cold case. Charron’s face: leave prints on you.
Break you down; put it together: I’ll jigsaw you.
Show up to your improv group, impromptu, insult the chick on you,
diss her, and spit on you. No, Diz / Eurgh spit on you.
I’ll diss her(Eurgh) and leave: Irvine crip on you.
Walk in your crib on you, skip the welcome mat, wipe my kicks on you.
Slap the cereal bowl out your hand and go Queenzflip in the whip on you
when I whip on you.
You know what? It’s something bothering me, I just can’t ignore it.
Everybody blames Sandusky; they got the facts distorted.
I mean, if you seen what Rone was wearing, he was practically asking for it.
Forget the rape. That’s a subject that we’ll avoid.
I mean, I had to mention it; I didn’t have any choice,
but now it’s a tactic employed he’s learned to handle with poise,
so fuck it, I’ll bell-clap him. Won’t hear any actual noise.
Flat on canvas, no punch landed; you scrapping with Floyd.
Shoulder lock, crack clavicle; grapple on point.
Jab like Zab; jaw tap him like Roy.
Body blow, head shot; his jaw crack like his voice.
Mandible snapped at the joint.
Hey yo Sandusky! That’s how you put hands on this boy.
And as you just seen, I beat his ass so badly,
I’m on my next lap. Next title match, me and Pass in Cali.
(Whassup?)
Top ten battle rappers of 2015, and the “Bar God” didn’t even make the list.
Every time you say “Bar God”, I want to walk in your kid’s birthday party, take a piss
on the cake and ice cream, stick a candle in it, and tell him make a wish.
They like, “why you disrespecting the Bar God?”
‘Cause what the fuck is a Bar God to a atheist?
Danny, I don’t believe in you.
Spit one bar about my ex-girls, and I’ma show what this heater do.
I’m trying to see if this bullet could tore(Couture)
through the right side of your body before it’s leaving you.
Rap about Ash, then you’ve.. gotta catch ‘em all; a bullet’s seeking you.
What I did to the body’s shocking; the kids don’t even want to peek at you(Pikachu).
This nigga look like two ninja turtles put together.
Fuck is you, Rapha-angelo or Dona-nardo?
You not a god, bro.
You never made Lux lean on the ropes, go toe-to-toe or had to box with Hollow.
You rap with speed, but that don’t make you a Creed. Nigga, you not Apollo.
You sloppy when you rush in(Russian) with the punches: that make you Ivan Drago.
When shit get Rocky, Clips get cocky. I got this big bravado.
Cannon under the Big T; let’s switch the scene, now we in Chicago.
Giving him 300 off one leg: that’s two Dirks. Did you niggas follow?
See they ain’t get it. I black out here and there; I got vitiligo.
Hold up. Y’all know what? I’m so motherfucking mean with it,
let’s bring that skin shit back and do a whole ‘nother scheme with it.
Danny, New York is mine. A nigga throw an event, then I want in.
Tonight if they make eleven racks, then I want ten,
but they paid me to make y’all go through bars. Well I’ma turn y’all into a wino then.
Even when I go light, I’m blacking out. That’s albino skin.
I’m in every league going loco. I don’t just do it for the Smack bread.
When I was younger, I had two twin ratchets on me.
That’s when I first learned how to clap lead.
With them two twin ratchets, I was short. So I was only hitting back leg.
Mary Kate and Ashley: when I got older, I seen them twin ratchets crack head.
Hold up. Y’all know what? I’m so motherfucking mean with it,
since y’all ain’t get the whole crackhead shit,
I’ll bring it back and do a whole ‘nother scheme with it.
Danny, if your House is Full of white, sit calm(sitcom),
‘cause I’m about to take this gun and put it to the bald scalp.
With a knife, I’ll get to cutting like a DJ, or give him a shell inside the boy mouth.
Mary Kate and Ashley: with them drugs, them twin ratchets is getting pulled out.
How ironic, for Danny’s tan, or(Tanner).. I’ll be running inside that Full House.
I told y’all I ain’t come to play with the “Bar God”. I’ma catch him with a mean gun.
Put a hole in his head, but not just any hole, the Rasheed one.
Tell my niggas to light it up, and then smoke him before the weed done.
I was trying to think of a slogan,
but when you kill a nigga this bad, you don’t need one.
Let’s get straight into these rhymes, homie.
I’m ‘bout to… I was just waiting on NuNu to call time on me.
This is Clips versus a nigga with clips. They know the fifth ‘ll blam.
His brain will spread for a couple of meters. That’s an attention span.
Listen, man. Play it cool, or else your man is buried.
He thought he was the g.o.a.t., ’til he ran into a man who was born in January.
I’ll cap a corn(capricorn).
This nigga don’t want to bang with Myers.
I’ll nail you in the street, leave you flat, then change attire(a tire).
Remember our phone battle, when I first killed you? Well now the gun is calling.
I’m Matrix through the phone: any second now, you should see the numbers falling.
Beef can last from day to night. Pay attention when you fucking with me, Clips.
A round ‘ll cover your son if my pockets on E, Clips(eclipse).
You peep this? Round, cover the sun, day to night I’m frying challengers.
I’ll catch your crew and mill any ‘em(millennium). That’s the Mayan calendar.
This the highest caliber. Bitch nigga, your whole set brittle.
My dick wrap around your girl throat like a neck pillow.
That tech peeling. One headshot ‘ll floor this nigga.
The kick won’t show mercy for Chuck Norris, nigga.
First, I’ll put the strap in your face, then lace his shit.
Then blow a hole through your bitch; she needed space in the relationship.
Face it, Clips. I don’t care if your damn marriage good.
I’m planning to pop one in her; that’s planned parenthood.
In beef, we ain’t always got to pull a gun.
We mail fingers to mothers; that’s a rule of thumb.
This fool is dumb. I’m a god, but you still got a brave heart.
But if we are(R) in a circle, it should Register we got to trade(,)mark.
I’m trying to save art. You cheat the fans. I let the thang spark.
It can’t be two g.o.a.t.s, and both of our careers not on the same arc.
I have flashbacks of shootouts, bullets dividing flesh.
Now I draw, off recollection; that’s a composite sketch.
You can put your fists up, but I’m holding some shit that’ll change the landscape.
What I grip ‘ll cover his knuckle like the Mason handshake.
I have a need to kill bitch ass niggas. It’s like a primal pressure.
My need ‘ll(needle) get shit sended; it’s like a final record.
Charlie, I checked backgrounds on your crew; ain’t no felons.
What’s your daddy really locked up for? Ain’t no telling.
But I could tell you this: you spit gun bars like you’re the baddest walking,
when all you’ll really do is Fire In the Sky like Travis Walton.
You’ll leave this planet. You can clown ’til someone abducts you.
You a foe(UFO), but you won’t get the picture ’til a round hovers above you.
We take the drama quite serious.
We drive through his hood ’til we spot his pad, like a light period.
It ain’t sweet. I got a bunch of homies from grape street.
If I sock you and don’t knock you out, you better fake sleep.
We eight deep. We’ll bring that eighty to your camp.
I’ll watch my dogs split your noodle like Lady and the Tramp.
Don’t be a diva, mister. Otherwise the whole team ‘ll split ya.
We’ll have it popping on the side your mouth like a fever blister.
I ether niggas, and he on the ground with this shit;
this wack emcee got another two rounds of this shit. Yikes.
Let’s get straight to the jokes.
Don’t front for these people like you some type of nice dude.
You gon cut me up a million times, weigh me on a conveyor belt,
say a joke - I look like Ah Di Boom mixed with Ice Cube.
Well, I’m from Harlem and I love to snap,
so if that’s the game you want to play, then I’ll play along,
and I’m so real with this shit, I won’t even change from Ice Cube.
In fact, I’ma perform one of my favorite songs.
Straight outta twelve racks, a stupid motherfucker named Danny,
gave his whole life savings up to Randy,
came home with no dinner for his family,
eight dollars left and he spent it on brandy.
Nigga, you pussy. Danny, you soft; that’s what my hood say.
Let a nigga take twelve racks from me, my whole hood spray.
This nigga gon be dead; Ice Cube won’t be able to perform “It Was a Good Day”.
My Boyz n the Hood ‘ll ride up, tell you, “hop in.”
Take the silencer, put the nozzle on,
he jump out the car. Funny ass nigga,
knew he ain’t have the heart(Hart) to Ride Along.
Them Ice Cube jokes won’t work, ‘cause you remind me of Eazy E.
Not ‘cause you fucking bitches raw, or what you do to females is trifling;
you remind me of Eazy E for a different reason.
Oh, pay attention, ‘cause the details is frightening.
See, Rex lied about getting locked up, and you knew it.
And I got a question: why D ain’t strike him?
He took your money and left you sick, blood,
you should’ve been in T cell fighting.
That last scheme was sick, by the way, but listen,
we can find a cure with all the money that Rex holding,
and since you got your money tooken from that nigga,
how ‘bout I hit him with Rex slogan?
I’ma pop Danny in the neck, and walk of with this nigga head.
Y’all know Rex slogan, right? (Crowd: This nigga dead.)
Yeah, this nigga dead once this nigga said,
“If I don’t get my money I’ma kill—“ and Rex still got this nigga bread.
He threw his hands up. I’m like, who still(steal) boxes? This nigga Craig.
Fuck a Friday, I get D bowed(Debo) and leave this nigga Red.
Why would y’all put the fastest internet connection up
against a nigga that’s just dial-up?
No lie, ’02 draft: I got a Rocket that could pick Yao up.
I started out with the Hawks, but my gun connect told me to switch my style up.
’01 draft: I got on my grizzly and picked the pow(Pau) up.
For my basketball niggas,
if you know the ’01 and ’02 draft, y’all gon say, “man, that shit crack.”
For the Danny Myers fans.. “Oh he spit his battle rap bars and basketball,”
y’all gon say that shit wack.
I’ll respect you if you get your twelve from Rex.
Well, you did battle him, so you might not get that,
but at least be a man, Danny. Ask K-Shine to get you six back.
(Oh, you not Dot Mob no more?)
You brought up that Rex $12k shit. What, y’all niggas trying to rob me?
Well tell your niggas come find me.
Bitch, I keep paper around me like the nigga behind me.
When we in the barber shop, you never get mentioned. Nigga, fuck favors.
You not a rider. We don’t Converse about anything that Chuck tailors(Taylors).
You better duck blazers. You’ll see the beam. We wild niggas.
When these arms crossed, you’ll get a boom. I beguile(Guile) niggas.
Oh, you and your niggas slipping? Cool. I’m holding them up.
You’ll say hi to this bitch like when Odom woke up.
Oh, guess which room you in? Ain’t no nigga cold as I.
I’ll start off shooting in the bathroom like GoldenEye.
Don’t stall on me. I’ll leave you in the dirt stinking.
You’ll be Stomped ’til your soul is God’s Property like Kirk Franklin.
I’m sir painting. I don’t talk this shit to generate likes.
Run in his house with the Mac-11 and renovate twice.
I’ll leave a painting on your wall of me shooting you in the head
just to show you how art imitates life.
I screw the silencer on the front of the barrel before the gat is burned.
All you’re hear is (psh, psh), like getting at a nigga bitch when his back is turned.
When will these rappers learn? Doubt that I’m heat and I’ma crucify him.
Then I remain silent, ‘cause everything you say, they trying to scrutinize it.
But who am I to say who’s top tier or how to do it proper?
I ain’t Mook or Hoffa, or dudes that’s got to got on stage in a suit and tie, but,
when you get this work, and ain’t satisfied with it, you get the supervisor.
Now we could go on and scrap, but my nigga would sneak behind you.
You get a hook that you ain’t even know was there, like a bonus track;
what’s wrong with cats?
You escaped death from Lux, barely.
You must be on rock, and roll if you want to be the one that Chuck bury(Berry).
What’s up, scary? Ain’t no way your team cook mine.
All my niggas rolling strapped like Bokeem Woodbine.
The young homies trying to earn their stripes; they know their role’s minor.
That’s why they’ll light on the top of your head like a coal miner.
Go ahead and act like you Apollo. You’ll feel the impact of a land mine.
Walk up on me while I’m holding the sawed-off, you out your damn mind.
Kneel(Niel). This arm’s strong(Armstrong).
You’ll be sent to the moon when I blam mine,
so take one small step, and you’ll take a giant leap for mankind.
(Just trying to put space between us.)
They want to know the physics of how I did it.
Lift the trey pound; calisthenics, blow you to the outer limits of our existence.
You’ll never catch me slipping; I even take a shower with it.
It ain’t gon make a minor difference;
I’ll spray the can and air out the room like it’s flower-scented.
Your hourglass ain’t got a hour in it.
Nigga, it’s nothing like me.
This is a nigga talking ‘bout “syke”, versus a nigga in his psyche.
Nike jacket cover my waist to hide the heater;
I’m getting paid to break down Clips like Roger Ebert.
If I text my nigga and tell him to shoot you, he putting one in your head, G.
Soon as he grab his phone and scroll, you’ll be dead, see?
If you thought I was gon bring up Couture or old angles, man, you missing the script.
This a empty gun: I don’t need ammunition for Clips.
I’m from where you stood in front of the man you get and you spit.
And this wack emcee got a whole ‘nother round of this shit. Yikes.
The plan was to kill Danny in December. But this nigga got a hundred kids,
so I figured ah, fuck it, let him enjoy his Christmas first,
‘cause December twenty-fifth is when you get the gift, but,
January tenth is when you get the curse.
Head shot; get a nurse.
Captain Planet: that mean clean him up. Lift his Earth.
All them bars niggas had about my pops;
well let’s talk about how you was trying to snitch on Surf.
You was on Angryfan yelling more than a angry fan.
You was showing niggas that you could scream well.
“Ah Di Boom wrote Surf bars, Ah Di Boom wrote Surf bars,”
you was on the phone sounding like a diesel female.
You know Ah Di Boom is doing time,
so he wouldn’t be able to call him and get the details,
but ironically, we ain’t have to give a Boom a ring(boomerang)
‘cause the shit came back around in the form of a email.
Ah Di wrote, and I quote, “I did not write for Surf.”
So you took a nigga fake situation, even tried to lie about it and hype it too.
“I got screenshots of Surf text messaging Ah Di.”
I wouldn’t be surprised if you was the one that typed them, too.
You not a Bar God, you a bar fraud; stealing some of my work is what you like to do.
Now I feel like Ah Di, ‘cause behind these bars, I got a right to sue(write to Tsu).
But I don’t like to sue, bitch nigga. Fuck court.
The streets is where I’m holding my trial.
I walk in while you playing with your son.
“Oh, you gon shoot the Bar God while he holding his child?”
Nah, I’ll walk off, hit him with that syke-I-lied, then start unloading the pound;
I don’t give a fuck. Your whole family is getting treys(trays): we at Golden Corral.
Hold up. You know what? I’m so motherfucking mean with it,
a fat nigga rapping about a restaurant? I got to do a whole ‘nother scheme with it.
I was on the phone with my nigga Buddens; he said, “eat him.”
I said, “Why, Joe?” He said, “‘cause that sucka food.”
I said, “the head shot gon be Sloppy, Joe, but man, which(Manwich) gun to use?”
What you got is salad bars.
You’ll probably let us(lettuce) put the banana clip on your Adam’s apple.
Man, if he don’t chill, he’s(Chili’s) getting hit with the gun
’til I crack a(Cracker) Barrel.
Niggas complaining about that recycling shit against Big Kannon.
Look what happened to Suge. I been on my grind since.
Sometimes when you freestyle you bug out.
Truth be told, I don’t know where my mind went.
What you with, four niggas on stage? Well, I’ma recycle again.
I keep that nine gripped,
act like I’m walking off, bring the can back and get five sent(cents).
Y’all saw State Property, right?
Hey Swave, in Harlem, we gon throw Danny a mean party.
Bunch of choppers in the shit like a mean homi, machines prob’ly.
But I don’t need a gun;
I’ll walk in swinging on everybody, like, “it wasn’t me, Charlie,”
I don’t give a fuck. Even the wrong niggas getting crowned; I feel like Steve Harvey.
I told this nigga, I’ma run on Danny with a mean gun;
put a whole in his head, but not just any hole. The Rasheed one.
Tell my niggas to light it up and then smoke him before the weed done.
I was trying to think of a slogan,
but when you kill a nigga this bad, you don’t need one.
…club just to bring the star.
I set it up, so I could tell you in your face, I’m the king of Harlem.
But my stories deeper; you’ll be left with gory features
when these kicks fly, and I ain’t talking ‘bout Mauri sneakers.
My Mexican plug said he could sell me forty cheaper,
so I got that Alien transporting with the white bitch like Sigourney Weaver.
You don’t got to understand the intricacies of my flowing and scheming
or notice the meaning, just know it’s demeaning.
I’m controlling a demon. I’m holding the secret.
You’re like D, how did I come up with this?
Long nose leading to a ruptured disk: snuffaluffagus’ trunk is sick.
Spare a nigga for real: stuff him up the trunk to fit.
His subsequent thoughts, tied up, is, “what the fuck is this?”
But this ain’t even about you. Even though I had to do this in person,
it was the disservice of your Diz verses that deserves this.
Bar God. I’m from a world where my pen’s perfect,
but in the underworld, it appears plain when I invert it.
I no longer have to punch these niggas.
A baldheaded man premeditating murder when I’m amongst(monk) these niggas.
Y’all can boo this(Buddhist), but it won’t cause my mind to worry.
Y’all must be off Buddha
if you can’t see between my temples lies a mind that’s scary(monastery).
Just you even being here in honorary.
My lines are worth money; you could put my bars on Ah Di Boom’s commissary.
I gave my young homie a pound of weed to get his first cake up.
That means I had the green on the corner with my pupil, like when you first wake up.
No joke, I should’ve walked in this bitch wearing a cloak.
The form of a droid was my apparent approach.
If there is a g.o.a.t., it’s always Lux, Hollow, Mook, and Clips,
but they fail to mention the West like we ain’t got shit to do with this.
This bias has to stop. Even the South got a few that spit.
Ha, I’m Official with double M, you stupid little bitch.
The hood loves Myers, ‘cause they can feel when he’s spitting.
I’m popping you point blank; you ain’t getting killed from a distance.
I’ll shoot you on this rainy day;
your coat fall in a puddle in front of your girl. You dead, but chivalry isn’t.
Fore real, I can feel the resistance. I’m spitting ’til he sleep in coffins.
This is Jesus talking with the mindframes of Stephen Hawking
when he was walking. Proceed with caution.
Ask his family, they know.
Who winning this battle? You can tell by they fucked up faces. Danny trey-oh(Trejo).
But the comments gon say “Clips 3-0”. They try to cheat Danny.
Let me introduce to the man that can beat Danny. Meet Danny.
For bitch niggas like you is why I keep the heat handy.
Get a Clue how I’m Fabolous with the king like the Street Family.
I’ma shoot your bulldog looking ass at all costs, and throw the weapon.
But don’t worry, Charlie. All dogs go to the heaven.
I’m a flowing legend, and you on the ground with this shit.
Thank the lord he ain’t got another round of this shit. Yikes.
Aye Verb vers’ Charlie Clips:
he said, “If a nigga wanna see that Holla and Verb,
put that money up, and I will not serve.”
So what the fuck are we battling for, Verb?
Those few bars alone already prove you not a man to your word.
You created who, me? Nigga, I perfected my grind,
‘cause Word War was yours, but it was technically mines.
I had the most wins, won the most money, battles stayed packed,
did the most views, I’m just naming facts,
but the long story short, for the people that wanna know,
it was Aye Verb’s stage. Your boy just took over the show.
This ain’t for the king of the city, I did this for whatever cash,
‘cause I can’t take a crown from him that he never had.
We could take to streets or keep it rap. It’s whatever Chaz,
but make the wrong choice, you gon leave here in a leather bag.
Aye Pops, niggas calling my phone, I’m like, “y'all don’t know nathin’.”
Handle what situation, Aye Verb? I got a degree in communications.
Hip thing off the dresser, I wish you would test us,
boy, I’ll expose Verb like a English professor.
You probably got a step on me in lyrics. That’s what you do the most,
but delivery and quotes? Ain’t even close.
Performance? I got you beat by a hundred bolts.
They laugh at you, not with you, you motherfucking joke.
Now I could’ve got personal, but I chose not.
And it’s BMG gang; we something you hoes not.
Close curtain how you get certainly closed in a box;
better do some soul searching or get your soul shot.
You will never run the streets, nigga, I’m a roadblock.
A couple niggas wanna call your bluff. I should auction you,
but I told niggas he cool. That’s what bosses do.
But watch what you say in your rhymes. Be cautious, dude,
‘cause I’ll forget it’s rap and stop your verse like, “who you talking to?”
It ain’t a street bone in his body, he’s not what he seem.
I punch niggas with no warning; been snapping since a teen.
And you look kind of confused; let me show you what that mean.
My set no playground, so I ain’t gotta get pushed for me to swing.
It’s a lot of weapons I could slay y'all with.
The black gloves, rubber grip with the radar chip.
I’ll come to one of Verb parties with a A.R. clip,
and shoot soon as I get in like I’m J.R. Smith.
Fuck it, I'ma remix it:
It’s a lot of weapons I could slay y'all with.
The black gloves, rubber grip with the radar chip. (x2)
I’ll come to one of Verb parties with a A.R. clip,
and shoot soon-and shoot soon-and shoot soon-and shoot soon-
and shoot soon as I get in like I’m J.R. Smith.
Matter fact you a bitch, man up, you need to bark when you bite.
You was a sucka back then; you a sucka tonight.
At any time you feel tempted, it’s nothing to fight.
I cut his ring off; my footwork tougher than Mike’s.
By the time that you agree, you get snuffed with a right.
You marketable; I’m remarkable. We’re nothing alike.
And you act the way you act because your mother’s a dyke.
(Throw some racks up?) when I rap; it’s fucking advice.
I ain’t an STL rookie my nigga; they threw the best on him.
Looking around, where the niggas that put the vets on him?
Let the caps fly on stage, go Rex on him.
Cash on his head, got money orders and checks on him.
Nigga you a bitch, no reason to pull a Tec on him;
I’ll put him way in the hole, I’ll in-debt homie.
You old ass clown, just an old ass noun,
let a young nigga shine. Sit your old ass down.
I know I said I could’ve got personal, but I chose not.
I was talking first round; second round, it gets hot.
Ballgame.
A nigga hit me up and told me, “Verb, Holla on YouTube dissing you.”
My first thoughts, “Holla? Nada, my nigga, go get a clearer view.”
He said “It’s Holla, I’m watching. Go watch it.” Instantly I got hot,
like, “This emotional, seven-day menstrual move weak pencil move
having, disloyal, bitch-made, fool-ass punk, this snake (inaudible)”
Clicked the link to the interview, to see what he trying to get into,
and this nigga says, “I’m mad at Verb 'cause he ain’t come to my Arsonal battle;
he ain’t call me in seven months.” Some shit a bitch’d do.
It’s pitiful how a million views could change Holla to a different dude,
but to me, he still that same bird-ass nigga
who never got bread, not even pigeon food.
He down, he call me for the loan. He who I give it to.
When his baby mama cheating on him with other niggas pitching woop,
I’m the shoulder he cry on; I’m the nigga who listen to.
Despicable, 'cause this lil’ nigga, I used to fuck with,
even would’ve gave my liver to. Nah.. that isn’t true.
But anywho, I gotta lynch this fool,
throw him in hot water like instant food. Heavy line; instant “ooo”.
Y'all got him chose, I get him chewed. This bitch confused,
‘cause round here, I got the motherfucking juice. Bars. Nigga, I’m witch’s brew.
Lyrical chikka-boom, give him another hole to whistle through.
Aim that cannon(Canon), flash, steel(still) shot, no picture booth.
Holla, killing you gon hurt me way more than it’s gon get to you.
I carefully crafted these rounds. Later, give him that lyrical shower; first,
for the villain to beat the superhero, you gotta strip him off his power first.
Reality check, Holla: you are not a young star, dog.
You’re twenty-four, and in December, you just bought your first car, dog.
Reality check, Holla: you a motherfucking fraud, dog,
but nigga, you’re so fraud, you don’t even know that you’re a fraud, dog
Reality check, Holla, and I really have to check that.
You are not, I repeat, you are not from the Westside.
You’re from Hazelwood, so throw up your H, bitch, and rep that!
Reality check, Holla. Before this battle shit kicked off,
you talking to bitches? Nah. Hitting bad broads? Hah.
You ugly ass little boy, you have the swagger of a guard dog.
Reality check, Holla.
You was a part of team from St. Louis before I kicked you out that squad, dog,
for taking too many shots, Mr. Ballgame, you’re a ball hog.
Reality check, Holla. He tell niggas he had a shootout
so y'all won’t think that he weak.
But he ain’t tell you, he was shooting that rusty thirty-eight
in the air from across the street.
And the niggas he was playing with, they was gonna smoke you.
But I called and asked for a pass, 'cause you was dumb with no culture.
I ain’t wanna see you dead or in a cell, you fucking fool.
But y'all, don’t score my last two bars. That’s just what a real nigga do.
Showtiiiiiime. On everything, I show Holla some shit he never seen.
Rewrite his life movie and put a scary scream in every scene.
A couple rings out that left ‘d make a levy lean.
When it’s war, I go heavy fiend: get that pipe, I smoke anything and everything.
Your little maggot frame get a casket.
Your little average dame, get bagged and banged
What you gon do? Slide up on me like baggage claim?
I go and get that stee(a)l, little nigga, I play the passing lane.
I’m in a cocky mood.
I’m beating up on this dead meat; I’m in that Rocky mood.
So our boy dropped you,
you went and hopped on Nelly dick faster than Ashanti do.
If you know anything about Hitman,
then you should know that I don’t mess around,
and when it come to this battle shit,
I do a lot of exposing in the second rounds.
First off, I told you in advance that you never stood a chance.
I’m greeted by demand,
and you can’t pull my card 'cause the city know my hand.
Speaking of hands, you and I both know that you never got choked.
You and I both know that whole rumor was a joke.
But the shit that you did had me heated through the charts;
I'ma tell y'all the reason he ain’t come with me for Ars.
Hanz had Verb spooked, I’m talking real bad.
I called Verb every day, after school, after class,
like, “Yo, you get your ticket? It’s about to go down,”
and he said every time, “I’m online now.”
But wait. I called the night before, he ain’t even call back.
Text me in the morning on some shit like, “I'ma fall back.”
If that ain’t phony or shady, then what you call that?
Respect that I once had for you, I want it all back.
Let me talk to this nigga, man.
Nobody give a fuck that your resume with the heavyweights
when you walk around with a heart that belong with featherweights.
Verb, nobody give a fuck that you fucking all of the ladies
when every battle rapper consider you as a lady.
Verb. And the nigga that protect you not gon come and help you,
or come to your rescue, 'cause I’m his nephew.
So all that guap game gon protect you? That’s so not the case,
‘cause where the fuck was Chase when you was getting chased?
You ran out of state, and punched in the face, on camera trying to escape,
man you so fucking— wait…
You mean to tell me, a nigga punched you in your mouth,
and all you did was pout? What’s that?
Now I ain’t saying walk around the city like a tough cat,
but it’s rules you learn as a kid; fuck rap.
A nigga curse you, it’s mandatory that you cuss back.
A nigga rush you, it’s mandatory that you rush back.
A nigga shoot at you, it’s mandatory that you bust back.
A nigga touch you, it’s mandatory that you touch back.
And you did a song with GSI behind Keith Wine(?) back,
and he used to give you money. Never mind, besides that,
you did some shit then showed you don’t want no contact.
GSI bombed first, when are you gon bomb back?
Let a nigga touch me. Tremaine, where them nines at?
We got ‘em. Banana clip, Mardi Gras, time strap,
(inaudible), shotgun, playboy, don’t never care.
All you here is “yett yett”, then blood flying everywhere.
I was the man at fourteen. I do what I does.
Before you battled SB, the Lou ain’t know who you was.
Limelight. We was trill, gangbanging for real. Niggas was getting killed.
We was out doing that, you was out at the Mills,
trying to sell jewelry, belts, watches, and heels,
(inaudible) on my son, I’m for real.
St. Louis, what the hell?
Y'all praise a nigga that tried to blackball Street Status from URL?
Oh, that’s on my son grandpap.
The nigga called my jack like, “Street Status is wack.
Wait 'til I call Smack; on a URL stage them niggas ‘d never rap.”
I hate to say it St. Louis, but that’s a motherfucking fact.

Aye Verb clown; this choppa ‘ll lay this nerd down
Let’s talk about that parking lot situ-uuugh. I'ma save that for the third round.
You old ass clown, just an old ass noun,
let a young nigga shine. Sit your old ass down.
Now this the round when I get lyrical.
I ride up on Holla like a car, and put lead in him like a pencil.
What? Them last bars, they didn’t stick like that?
But y'all scream and go crazy when he say shit like that.
Explain me this 'cause I don’t get it yet.
You rep Westside, Blood gang, 50-100 block, (Kates) and (Isrite),
right? Right? But how? 'Cause little nigga, that’s a Crip set.
But let me guess, since you do so much Westsiding and bloop-blooping,
that they just gon let you Soo-woop it, right?
Bitch, you sound stupid.
It’s sucka in you Holla, real niggas can read that shit.
Plus it’s coward in you too, 'cause you bleed that shit.
I ride on niggas like a gangster with just me, that’s it.
If this was football, I’d be Barry Sanders. You’d be Emmitt Smith.
'Cause you run behind your block; I don’t need that shit.
If I catch him outside and tell this bitch nigga, “man up,”
he gon’ be like, “mannn..” Man, what?
“I’m just saying Verb, on my mama, ball game
Wait 'til my mama get here. Wait 'til my mama get here.”
Man, shut up little nigga, you ain’t reckless. You bang? Never.
I’m a one-man slave special, get your whole gang wet up.
I come to you first, then all they cribs: I’m like a chain letter.
You on that sizzy? Look, brother, this my house, heathen.
You lizard looking motherfucker. Mouse eater.
How you gon stand here and belittle niggas,
when you run around screaming, “you see me” for Murphy Lee?
Don’t nobody see him, so you just a little nigga’s little nigga.
I’m a grown man, Holla. I’m almost 30, a boss.
You ain’t street; they think you street because you dirty and dark.
You ain’t a killer, you a dolphin: you just related to sharks.
I grab that eagle, let it fly until that birdy get lost.
Fuck it, be soft, dog. Mardi Gras parade in reverse:
I throw something, he catch it, and then it take his top off.
This lyrical hot sauce, should I stop? Nah, watch:
I made you and I made me.
They see you and be like “who?” They see me and be like “G.”
The club play you, but they pay me, so where the fuck is your fame?
It’s like I was playing Mortal Kombat on Sega Genesis with your career,
and pressed A, B, A, C, A, B, B, 'cause I put blood in the game.
Now let that marinate. My spot permanent, it’s very straight
Slow it down. My spot perm in it; it’s very straight
You a ground-level featherweight
fucking with a heavyweight that can mid-round levitate.
Forty got seventeen; you take five like I told you take a break.
Nah, let’s take that back.
He say I’m over the hill. Damn, ain’t that strange.
I come with a gun that’s Grant’s age.
Scope on it, go on a rampage, and get to shooting from Durant range.
Big boy bars. Stay in your ant lane.

Knock, knock. You know what that mean, I’m back on my bullshit.
Bow. They say they want the Hitman back; I’m on my old shit.
Now I’m in his crib, his granny up by her toes shit.
Where his newborn? I stuff him up in the stove shit.
Auntie throat slit, yeah, out of control shit. Oh shit,
Ars treatment.
What up, Chaz? With all them weapons and them things you shoot,
I saw that footage and you got some explaining to do.
How many niggas chased you, was it two?
Some brown skin nigga with waves, was it you?
The camera don’t lie, if you watch and see.
It’s some URL battle rap nigga running through a park again.
People, his name start with a C.
Fuck it, let’s get straight to the facts, Verb.
Them niggas that chased you is right by that bar.
Go ahead, chase them niggas back, Verb.
Smack, you got (inaudible) of them guns, you better warn him.
I ain’t saving no more rappers, I’m killing all them.
I load up that Mac like I’m putting air in a Spalding.
Blaow. Run up on me, you leave crawling.
I’m eating real well. I could tell you starving.
But fuck rap, let’s get it on: Marvin.
Niggas know the deal, I’m too Ill. Marlon,
he’s soft. He see me and change up like a Marlin.
(inaudible) baddest. I came up the fastest,
but fuck top tier, give me that underdog status.
I walked in, hugs from the bitches. The baddest.
He walked in, tragic. No looks: Magic.
(inaudible), I’m a motherfucking savage.
For(‘fore) the Bills, I turn into a Gator like Brandon.
All this battle rapping and you broke? No bank account on Chase?
Saint Louis, slow it down.
I said all this battle rapping and he broke, no bank. Aye count on Chase.
Come on Verb, like, out of all people, you know, I do not play.
So you can save all that cool shit for a hot date.
How you feel (inaudible) and then the knot play.
How you want it, chalked up, or picked up the mop way?
Found in a swimming pool, or left under the dockway?
Head coach style, go listen to what the Doc say.
Female bitch, should’ve listened to what your pops say.
One of us the face of the Lou, and he is not gay.
A quick snipe. I’ll let two go blaow.
He’ll leave the city to play with Angels, Pujols style.
Calicoe, put on a Ballgame shirt 'cause I’m repping you; I feel that.
Blackface said I’m one of his faves, this a trill fact.
It’s my second time making top tier feel wack
‘cause it’s a difference between metaphors and real rap.
Aye Verb can’t keep up with the baddest.
Maybe my nigga Ill, but I got stronger after Street Status.
Saint Louis, what up? I show him what a college thug 'bout.
Right jab, something like lightning, I knock a bulb out.
I’m talking right now, I don’t give a fuck what you was 'bout.
Grown man what? This a grizzly to a cub scout.
You supposed to be a boss? Well tell Smack bring the gloves out.
Old ass clown, just an old ass noun,
let a young nigga shine. Sit your old ass down.
Ballgame.

Holla, you such a fraud, aren’t you?
A nigga swung on me when I had a cast on, my foot was just broke,
but when Twin swung on you, you just broke.
It wasn’t a broken bone on you.
Truthfully, everybody knew that it was nothing that you can do with me.
The test was, could I kill you beautifully and leave here without a bruise on me.
You ain’t moving me. Bitch get worried;
my last round was your obituary. This one is your eulogy.
You a snake in the grass, Holla.
But how you gon hide in that grass once I remove the weed
and everyone can view and see?
You might not get it now but at the end of this round, you’ll see.
Real quick, if we was slaves and had a New York slave master,
and the master came and said,
“Now, which one of you country negroes wanna be my new house nigga?”
He ’d kneel quick. I get to picking my cotton, I’m on that field shit.
I’m driving Saint Lou to success. You made the wheel shift.
I’m trying to destroy these New York niggas; he trying to build shit.
I knew one day, this was gon be a match I had to deal with.
I blame me. I should’ve stopped you before you got started, like a kill switch.
You made fun of Arsonal for driving that school bus to feed his people?
That ain’t real shit.
But you riding with all these kids like you on a motherfucking field trip.
I will get that tool and let it rip,
go to work and put a drill bit in every nigga that you chill with.
And I throw a steel fist, you never will, bitch.
We never saw, we just heard you a swinger. Nigga, you Will Smith.
If this was Menace II Society, you know who the fuck that we are?
I be OG Wax; Ill, O-Dog; this nigga Caine, like, “Look man,
I’m just trying to do my thang, I ain’t dissing no East Coast niggas, alright?”
Nigga, get the fuck out the car.
See, to y'all, he may appear cool. I know him, so I don’t feel dude.
Your character’s similar to flea market, Holla: ain’t nothing real in you.
You make me mad, 'cause you use this hood act like it’s a fad,
throw up your red rag and sag,
and say “on my momma” behind everything,
but you got everything a nigga who come from nothing never had.
You got a momma and a dad. You’re privileged, but you're too ignorant to admit it.
Holla, seventy-five percent of black fathers don’t even visit.
I been to your crib many times. That shit roses and bubbles.
I watched your momma hug you. But your father doesn’t love you.
‘Cause he let you be a sucker.
When a father loves his son and the son means the world to the father,
son get to going down that road, you grab him up by that collar,
like, “Listen, your name Gerald. Let’s chill with all this Holla.
You a athlete with no rap sheet.
You ain’t ever clip rounds or bust a zip down, hoe sit down.
You ain’t never been in a dope house where the dope fiends smoke up,
see that thick cloud, smell that aroma, and almost throw up.
You ain’t never had to hustle, get a pack and swear it came from the border,
that shit don’t lock up, you hit the block up and still get it off to the snorters.
See, I worked all my life so that life you never would see,
so when you claim you from the hood, that’s disrespectful to me.
I married your momma as a chess move.
I ain’t wanna see you getting stepped to by some step-dude.
Yes fool, I kept you in the best shoes, put you in the best schools.
Stop telling people that the mob is your crew,
‘cause when the mob fuck niggas up,
them niggas that they fuck up, they only know you.
So nigga, stop getting on camera saying you popping them guns.”
Aye Big Gerald! That’s the way you talk to your son.
Every time I see your face, I envision a rage.
I wanna get me a blade and hit your chest til it resemble a maze.
I tell my niggas "promote that choppa”, that mean give it a raise,
and let it get wild like Jerry Springer, every time he put the niggas on stage.
I want him dead, I get him well hunted.
Twelve shooters, hundred round drums, this fool done.
Run up on Gerald, give Mr. Fulton that full ton.
I took this battle for the bread and to get this shit clear.
Denzel voice from Training Day. “Nigga you just live here; I run shit here!”
Ballgame.
Ten battles in ten months; it’s like I’m in a tour,
but I’m in a door, but wait a second. Give me a minute or
I’m bringing ratchets out, like a Erica Mena tour.
Show your homies a(-)round, like I’m giving your men a tour;
as quick as a minute tour, your men are tore.
Being bull-headed getting your man bodied like a minotaur.
Yeah, this is war. Cross the line, you getting roughed up.
I said I’d never take you, but I’m here, so you done lucked up.
I made Conceited pump his brakes;
now I got his heir against the ropes being stuck up.
But that’s a synonym scheme: I made Conceited pump his(pompous) brakes;
now I got his heir against(arrogance) the ropes being stuck(-)up.
Soon as the gun cock he(cocky) ducking big heads
from the Eagle(ego); trip and you getting fucked up.
But what, now you wanna be humble and try to change the plot?
The stainless Glock, steel cock on his roof, weather vain(weathervane) or not,
but even if I rush more(Rushmore) with the pen, I rap ill.
I don’t ever rest(Everest), and these(Andes) type lines you lack still.
Showing him a layer(Himalaya) of penmanship that’s real,
a Range of wordplay. You ain’t a(-)mounting to this cat’s skills(Catskills).
It’s getting Rocky for you. I’m too clever.
You falling off, and to sum it(summit) up, I’m at my peak;
that’s why my view(‘)s better.
You should’ve knew better Q. Now you got to play scrambler,
or I'ma whip out a knife, and let a blade damage ya,
wait till your cheek get sewed up and they bandage ya,
then y'all seein Stitches getting punched; I'm Game’s manager.
I had Saga looking like a lame amateur;
I could’ve swept through that whole class and played janitor.
They gon have to change cameras; they gon have to hold the time.
Your plasma getting splattered on the lens if I'm unloading nines,
What up Q? Before you respond(respawn),
blood coming down the screen; y’all gon' think we playing GoldenEye.
And Quentin thought the culture lied, like, “the votes on them polls is madness.”
Who's the Kingpen? Well, if I don't hold the status, then Zone should have it,
but Jones established, with loads of classics proving my foes are average.
That's why they dial us(Dallas), ‘cause with the mark Q been(Mark Cuban),
he should own the Mavericks.
I'm loading ‘matics, but back in the day I was way saner,
starting peeling(pilling) and packing pounds with no weight gainer.
Could’ve aimed the can at Brixx(bricks), like a spray painter,
but squeezing on this body gon make for a better body like a waist trainer.
You a straight hater. I'm know you want to be the death of me.
Yeah, but I beat every Son clear. Why would you step to me?
I make quick work of these jerks, and do it impressively,
stopping the Sons like that . Shit feel like half of a sec to me(vasectomy).
You disrespected me, saying you would retire you if you lose a round.
Oh you mean, like a car? That's some tactical stuff,
'cause a car has to re-tire if it loses a round.
Well at least now you know why I'm jacking you up.
Now am I rapping too tough? That's ‘cause I'm hot-headed, fever pitching.
Bury his whole fam, but make sure his wife the lowest(Lois) like Peter Griffin.
I'm heater gripping; he'll be paraplegic, feeling like his feet is kicking,
but looking at his legs, wondering why the femurs(FEMA’s) missing,
like Katrina victims.
All photos by Smart Alix.You need a system, and assistance, to beat me in this ring. In fact,
here's a tip: bars ain’t enough to kill me. You better bring a strap.
Here's another tip: don't rewind none of your lines and try and bring it back,
you copy? Now you stuck with a couple pointers like a Chinese finger trap.
See the thing is that, besides this battle, you ain't got shit to lose.
What you gon do, say that I'm boring and I make niggas snooze?
Say I stole my whole style from you, but you came with some iller moves,
then use bars from up and comers, and say that's the shit that Chilla do?
That's too predictable. It's like your obsessed with me, oddly.
I bet, you've played this matchup out in your dreams probably.
I'm just tryna beat my last performance; it seems cocky,
got to make sure the punches heavy, the schemes godly.
But you really think I'm focused on Q.P.? Hardly.
I ain’t even see this bitch on the card; I’m Steve Harvey.
Copy. I know some people say I sound like you,
but I will never be a mutherfucking clown like you.
Bosstown.

Who wore the pants that Chilla wore today? Nobody. Nigga you Keith Sweating.
You in a tight(s) situation. Nigga, these leggings.
Speaking of these leggings, you probably had to to squeeze each leg in.
It’s nothing to chalk and outline these squares; that’s hopscotch.
With that Tommy, he’ll figure(Hilfiger) it out as soon as it crop tops.
Nigga, you won’t beat me. Rain, sleet, hail, snow, nigga, hell no. Under no conditions.
Not Chilla the stealer. What we fitting to talk about? I suppose it’s snitching?
What we talking ‘bout, nigga?
The coke addiction, the hoes, the pimping, the ghosting, tripping, the stolen chicken,
what we talking ‘bout, nigga?
Swave wilding out(Wild’n Out), Con, the other Khan, the Jew, Soul ‘ll visit,
what we talking ‘bout, nigga?
The Maury Show, the story goes how I had my hoe and both my twins,
and, what we talking ‘bout, nigga?
To separate from yellow tape in the second day and roll in bricks,
and how ‘bout we talk about
the cab he came in, the tax he claiming, and how he been so dependent,
and how he call himself Kingpen ‘cause behind bars, nigga, you known for snitching.
See, I(C.I.) know you’ll roll over on your co-defendant for a lower sentence;
he hates to steal bars, but don’t judge him, ‘cause he do it with no conviction.
Nigga, you’re not top tier at Smack anymore; I’m not trying to offend you.
Smack gave you life on Easy Street based on the comp that they give you.
Last guy, you didn’t have to study for. Prep, he had scholar potential.
Then they gave you another no-name; what was his name?
Oh yeah, Th3 Saga continues.
They say this clown got the “It” juice, something I couldn’t ignore.
In my head, dice rolling, like I done seen this woofing before.
No, in my Head ICE role, and, I done seen this Wolfing before.
He think he unruly ‘cause he battle niggas with one foot in the door.
Nigga, I was booking whooping before slaving, long before you ever got a boat ride.
I was Hanz on the way over, out of control; my hands were on the boat tide.
I was Prepping to Smack you new niggas out of your boat ties
way before you prepped to smack NuNu’s nigga out of his bowtie.
Both eyes on my pupil, I had to examine your past.
You were in that loner boat, you know, where every friend(-)ship skips past.
Too shy to raise his arm and lift a hand in a clash;
you got to understand that he bash..ful, a personality that a mannequin has.
Nigga, I’ma show you how to liven it up, nigga. And with the swag,
lookit, lyrically and physically with the punches and with pizzazz.
Get it? Lyrically with the punches and.. with pizzazz,
but physically with the punches and.. whip his ass?
Nigga, you looking for gore, then(Gordon) I’ll be back in a Flash.
I’ll leave this gig, then come right back in a Flash,
like, “remember me?” See, now, timing’s what I happen to have;
I’ma keep it G real with you, cuz.
When I went to Angryfan’s Facebook group, and I seen niggas in there dissed me,
I hit up Angryfan like, “Get me on air quickly.
I need you to set up the next show and get it clear with me.”
Then I thought about it. These niggas only use scandals to keep your ears busy.
They don't want the truth; they want the ratings. They don't care really,
so I switched up, like fuck it, 'cause Angryfan ain't gon play fair with me.
Maybe I'm bi(-)polar, and don't pan the(Panda) camera.
I'ma answer all the rumors you hear swiftly.
Been on my grizzly, but be coo’; I’ll a(koala)ddress it, just bear with me.
Yeah, dig me. If it seems like I'm giving off a murder vibe,
it’s 'cause I want to steal on you for the verbal lies that you verbalized.
But why waste a punch?
If he sees me throw a duke, he dropping. My hands certified,
shit. But thats a synonym scheme:
Why (waste) a punch? If (feces) me throw a (dookie dropping). My hands certified,
Truth is, he's deterred(turd) by the shit 'cause I’m a newer(manure) breed,
but he prefer the lies(fertilize).
Every battle I put on a show, from the moment that the curtains rise,
cursing life’s curses and writing verses til it hurts inside.
For what it's worth,
shit I know what it look like to y’all. I admitted that when I first denied,
but it was so ridiculous to me at first, it wasn't worth replies,
as most of y’all dismissed it, and it climbed up in it's hearse to die,
QP used his energy to keep the controvers’ alive.
He analyzed every worded line to see what he could search and find,
and, what a shocker. Over twenty-five battles, some coincidences occurred; it's fine,
but now y’all think I watch battles from smaller leagues and research for lines,
which is absurd, but y'all doubt me on my word, like it's the perfect lie.
This clown should be in the circus. He ain't what he seem on the surface side.
If y'all can’t tell he has a motive or a purpose why, then your circuits fried.
Y'all thought this perp ‘ll(purple) slide,
like I ain't gon' black on him? That would be a blunder.
After you brown-nosed Angryfan, my angry fans began to tweet a brother,
then something I read(red) blew(blue) me away, ‘bout how you steal deposits.
Aren’t(orange) you the one taking green from others?
But I ain't gon yell o(yellow)ver the shit.
Just know if we collide, a scope(kaleidoscope)’ll have you seeing colors.
I know; those bars were basic and inferior for rhymers,
but everything ain't for the cam, y’all.
I brought a color scheme for the room like interior designers.
Here's a reminder: you go hard, but I go harder.
Think you can win? I don't fault ya, but I don't falter.
You just follow my every move like a psycho stalker.
Now you’re career’s on the line like a tightrope walker.
I'm gon chalk ya. This how karma do you.
If your angel here(hair), alarm your boo boo,
And if she prego, then I’m airing near her(marinara) stomach, drawing two tools.
It's shells over sauce when what I pull is on ya(lasagna) noodle.
How come every time you pen a(penne) line,
you act like I'm the best impostor(pasta)?
Well I'll put bucks in the stock, nigga, show you how to invest a dollar.
Did that shock you? Oh well. I'm just trying to send a message proper,
then I'm shocking your dogs’ necks like electric collars.
Holler back. I’ll follow, you and your Miss, Q. I won't miss. <Qwoo, Qwoo>
No miscue. They'll be saying, “we miss Q.”
The pistol I wave move crews(cruise) and leave them sea sick;
the ratchet lick a(liquor) shot off the body like a freak bitch,
not to mention, if I’m at(@) you with a sub, it ain’t a sneak diss.
It’ll sit you down just to pick you up like a ski lift.
This the Kingpen. Y’all think he going vers’ me for the name?
My shit is Magic; he just trying to prove he Worthy in the game.
Play hero(-)in(e) O.D. for trying to murder me in vain(vein),
and get bucks from the pound like currency exchange.
I’m insane. I know some people say I sound like you,
but I will never be a motherfucking clown like you.
Bosstown.

Y’all indecisive on that first round? That’s what you make of Q?
If I lift the cal(cow) on him, is that still debatable(bull)?
I ain’t Mickey, this ain’t Disney, but I came many(Minnie) of miles on him.
Your click ain’t got a father figure for any, then I’ll son them.
I’ll sit your whole circle down while spinning around on him;
you know, duck, duck, goose, you know, Indian style on him.
We clocking these rounds on a old timer or a watch? Nigga, let’s decide.
Against Daylyt I got cut a minute short. That’s sixty seconds; fine.
Go against the agreement here, and I get anything less than time,
and I get stopped, watch and get clocked, soon as I get pressed for time.
Nigga, your techs and nines?
I don’t want to hear your about your fucking bars with a gun; it’s a fable.
I know you gon ignore the shit and rap about the shit one minute later.
I’m the DJ: every time, I’m in the club with a banger.
I got a revolver so big, when it’s slugs in the changer,
I need a court recess for me just judging its chambers.
Aim at y’all necks, Friday, done. I’m already on the move with
my cousin, for the record, shopping: I’m Craig on his new trip.
J.J., Dede, remember the chocolate Payday story he told Roach after only two hits?
That just go to show you, like Craig, since a kid, I been on that pool shit.
Brew wits; potions, elixirs, shots. Potions, remedy;
shit that’ll play with your mind, and invoke you mentally.
I’ll unfriend you on Facebook, my nigga, then come poke you physically,
then hold a spoon to your open wound to add insult(salt) to injury.
He say, “See, like my GPS, I ain’t never lost.”
See, it’s lines like that, and robbing like a bitch, I should Set It Off.
For wilding, I should hire a hitman and pay the extra cost,
‘cause you’d be more beneficial dead. What’s that? Better offed.
I had to head east to find a bird this soft; faster foes peep.
He didn’t want to take me. He’s piano lessons: ask him low key.
Nigga, but I text him all caps with a mad emoji,
trying to back out. I made him do it. Chilla, now that’s a cold feat(feet).
This nigga came in the game fronting the Kingpen;
see old Jerome here the same as Ross.
How you get here with the RICO, nigga, when you never paid the cost?
I don’t buy bull(bible); that’s ungodly. Pray; I just can’t exhault.
They call me GodPen, ‘cause this is how Jesus would’ve came across.
I pray to god: I say, “it’s through you I do everything.” Yep, that’s what I told the lord.
They say me and him in the same boat, when we ain’t even close for sure(shore).
I’m the captain; skip a nigga who ain’t never been on a boat before.
No, I’m the captain, skipper, nigga. Who ain’t never been on a boat before?
Is C(sea) sick? ‘Cause now I see a nigga going overboard.
Lock you up, close the doors, nigga, you taking the charge.
C.O. Jerome here probably think he’s safe with the guards.
Nigga, you catching wreck in the bathroom, or it’s straight to the yard.
You KingPen, but you ain’t Chapo, you not escaping this bars.
Now that was fire; I was gonna chill, but shit, I’m just getting warmed up,
I mean I swear. It’s gon be the first time somebody in jail got smoked;
you KingPen in this joint? Good. Take this L(el), Chapo.
Nigga, you always come with the toy lit(toilet); by now you’d think it was seeking.
You like Dot with the punches how you always reach at the peak end.
You always doing a stretch. I guess it’s ‘cause you think you a KingPen,
but this nigga probably wake up from sleep and he’s scheming.
This nigga wake up, fold your blanket before you go and get a coffee,
put on your white Iversons, say some shit like, “Yo, this shit is saucy.”
Nigga you walk around reaching all day. I know it get exhausting.
You walk through a plethora of butterflies like, “Yo, get ‘em off me, get ‘em off me.”
You what Chilla told me? Beat him, become a winner. My climate would then feel
like my fans be through the roof; oo. Nice, it’s a win(d) mill.
You crack me up. What’re(water) you thinking? That’s ice on the windshield.
I don’t know how cold your goal is, but mine is win(d), Chill.
You got lost and found yourself in somebody else’s jacket
when you got out the freeze.
You taking raps off-hand; cut the crap. This is how you thief,
running with that jester, you’re a clown to me.
Go ahead and steal(steel) all around to the point they got to crown you king.
I’ll use commercial transportation to try to help explain his fault.
Him and his crews(cruise) in the same boat, washed up, never taking off.
That carry-on line you stole from Big T? Nigga, plain(plane) was cough.
When you bus(t) a flow, it’s with somebody else’s train of thought.

Until now, every league that tried to set this up, I refused it.
I only took you, 'cause I said in my head, “Fuck it, it's time to do it.”
Y'all say my luck’s(Lux) up like he gon show up with a coffin and put me right into it.
I tuned it out. For the record, I juke boxes like diner music.
If he lose it, he'll say New York is biased, so why should Brooklyn choose him?
He said his battles, I look and viewed them
for techniques, then I took and used them.
Y’all seen Q lend e’rry(culinary) art to me, right?
Now watch me cook and(cooking) school him.
This crook foolin y'all. For that, I’ll make his life span shorter.
I don’t like you. You a dishonest, pill-popping gram snorter.
You say a lot of shit about the boy up on them camcorders,
but now that we adjacent, state them(Jason Statham) like the Transporter.
Lemme state mines. I don't like how every year his crew switch.
You came in repping SONS, now you found other dudes to move with,
then you got all buddy buddy with Born, on some new(Nu) shit;
nowadays it's Qleen in(cleaning) his ear givin Q tips.
Truth is, shit never ends in your crew’s favor.
Where was the bail money when Bonnie got Booked?
When Born was couch hopping, where was Nu’s(news) paper?
Remy owed money out in St. Louis.
He was ducking Magazines from them tool sprayers,
but Bro sure(brochure) act like getting money is in they true nature,
Fronting like your groups major. Innuendo.
Where if you ain’t with it then we… in ya window,
but if you with it when it’s finished, in the end you win dough.
The kid’s getting spanked by the ruler; I ain’t a N-U-N though.
I made it though to see a scenario where in the end you win though.
I mean your second round was fire, but no I’m bout to smoke QP.
Shit, I guess in the end you endo.
A pin code: I’m money on these battle rap stages.
Your baby moms already expose your battle rap wages.
I bet you brought every punch in your notebook, back to back pages.
But you make twelve hundred a year off battle rap.
You should go back to Backpages,
Outrageous. Every year you out here snitching and saying names,
creating scandals for your peers for a quick few days of fame,
and meanwhile, you rely on being an escort for making change.
Your Backpage ads say, "If you're male, it's extra.” What’s “extra”?
And I ain't playing games.
He gave his old bitch an STD, left her burning, and she hate the pain.
That's why his ex-ting wish a(extinguisher) big can would spray the flame.
It's lame. So what you gon say? I should hit you up for ghostwriting,
'cause there's a lot of things you can help me with?
Nigga you suck dick for money. As far as I'm concerned, you can't tell me shit.
You unhealthy bitch. I’ma show y'all this fiend is stupid.
I’ll take him(Kim) to my connect out in Brooklyn,
figure out which door he in(Dorian) and lead them through it,
and I'll be Frank like, "Q came Miles, and L(Andell)’s ain't working;
the weed is useless.
He took an X pill on the way here, so, shit, I figure a little mo’ E sh’(Moesha) do it.”
I told you, my man a modern day Escobar.
Then I left, and he got swarmed by the set so hard,
they took his sneaks, took his phone, even his metro card,
so you could say I played Q better than Fredro Starr.
Bars. But I ain't tryna call cops to arrest Q,
I told y'all I came for the kill. I'ma rest Q.
Let's go. Fresco better come to your rescue.
It's true. I'm a big dog, ready to crash barriers;
ironic how your name is Qleen but you back terriers(bacterias).
He scarier than most, but you could lie some more,
acting like you a gangsta that bring rivals war.
Who put batteries your back? Check his spinal cord,
you’ll look and(N) see(C) double A’s like the Final Four.
Lord. It’s a new day fam,
so when you think who got the juice,
put my face in the picture(pitcher) like the Kool-Aid Man.
Damn. You thought you would win, and that's why you losing now,
but what did you expect Q? You always been a loser clown.
It's time you should retire, 'cause we all seen you lose a round
against Mr. Jump-to-Top-Tier-from-the-Proving-Grounds.
Bosstown.
Go ‘head, Chilla. I only do coke, and you keep trying to say it’s crack.
Keep bringing up the male escorting shit; well bitch, you fitting to pay for that.
So you a writer and Uber driver. Kick your shit into gear.
You battled me ‘cause you said your daughter had a wishlist this year.
So you hook her(hooker) up with Jon Dough; now you the pimp it appears.
My gift happens to be why your daughter gets Christmas this year.
This shit just gets weird,
I mean, battle rapping it, taxi cabbing it, I don’t know many that would.
But if the pay is what you say, then I guess really he should.
I mean, you’re jobless; it’s a fair opportunity, there’s ain’t plenty of joobs.
I’ll spell it out for Chill, a J-O, any(N-E) is(S) good.
And when he in hoods, you got to understand it looks
a little weird you in your rear-view as each demand getting took.
I ain’t talking Smack, but I got a ‘ac, nigga, where you can get booked.
You make an arm and a leg just walking on people hand and foot.
This man chin, look. Before I even start rapping in here,
I got to address Chilla’s unsuitable razor bumps; they been slacking for years.
All’s well that ends swell; that’s what’s happening here.
Did the keloids crawl down from the back of your ear?
Got to your jaw like, “All right, start unpacking, we’re here.”
Did that get under your skin? Good, nigga, it matches your beard.
As it appears, you’ve been faced with a bunch of hard bumps.
Are you abreast that under your neck maybe you got a couple large lumps?
I’ma box you then re-box you and let you attach a large pump
to connect the dots on the neck you got to that Lettie Debbie Star Crunch.
Nigga them shits is juice pack fruit snacks; every one he cut gushes.
The goat’s girl got, it’s got a little bumpy, but fuck her,
I mean, she like, you know how it be. I know your honey must suffer
when morning sex expose your neck.
What’s she see when your honey nut? Clusters.
I’ll bump the goat right here. I’m just waiting for this shit to pop.
I make the swipe, pussy, break out. Just know that this pimp ‘ll(pimple) knot
the side of your head. Slow it down. Oo. Those are temple shots.
Get it? Slow it down, the side of your head: those are both temples. Hot.
Simple thought. You Uber-smart. Not only cabbing, but you hype hype.
Lot hype like your favorite song is rapping.
Nigga, Qleen popping with me;
two-choppa ‘sembly. When these chrome is clapping,
both them bitches singing. That’s Tamar and Toni Braxton.
We’ll turn the inside of your whip into a Queenzflip song reaction.
He known for snatching. Nothing original about none of your raps.
Umbilical cord: boy, you could see sons(SONS) is attached.
Then you copy like a bitch, and got the stomach to match.
Nigga them razor bumps the only time you’ve made something from scratch.
Nigga you fucked with a cat who ain’t fucked with; it's cap.
Nigga, he beat his self, it’s the same.
You call yourself Chilla still(steal), nigga, that in itself it explains.
You KingPen? That’s got to be the most selfish of claims.
Don’t shy(Chi) away from these two L’s, ey(A), I’m spelling your name.
Nigga, you fell in a grave, stealing shit. Kid that you morbidly would do.
The flows you’re taking’s your motivation and forcibly the muse.
It’s hard to digest; I just, upchuck orally when you
come up on up-and-comers like fifty-eight names who don’t normally get views.
But it’s the Patriot Act; see, his game tape’s getting formally reviewed.
Catching up to you, I guess you bit off more than you could chew.
If you beat me a round, I’ll retire. No flipping word-spin.
I’ll retire, as in, nigga, no longer working.
I got to win every round; my career’s going on thirty.
No; I’ma win every round. My career’s going on. Thirty.
Qleen Paper on Traphouse: nigga, I ain’t showing no mercy.
First thing’s first thing. W on my porch, don’t be stupefied,
especially taking my steps to blow up; nigga, you using mine.
You coke reaching; I start teaching the moment I toot a line.
They call me GodPen, ‘cause cross me, and Jesus, you’ll get crucified.
So, they're like, “Soul, you think Caustic’s gonna play you for a mark?”
Doesn't matter. This’ll be the last battle they do on the card.
Then I seen we’re on day one. This should’ve been day two from the start,
‘cause if he try punk me, we’ll have to host day 2 in a park.
‘Cause I ain't fuckin scared of you, and I don't care how hard I hit.
I don't care how big you are and I don't care who started it,
‘cause when Bigg K put it on him, we seen him start to shit
and make more excuses for the third round than Charlie Clips.
Like, “Listen to me, K. Listen to me, K.”
Your voice is filled with broken glass; how'd we listen to it break?
I mean, we're similar in ways. We both got pushed by someone bigger than us, mate,
but the difference is you bitched out and I hit you in the face.
So b-b-b-bully who? You think I'm actually shook of you?
Well I’m not, cause you'd bully him, but theres no way that he'd bully you.
And they say you're not a bully anymore ‘cause a bully bullied you,
but you pick and choose who you bully, and that’s exactly what bullies do.
So he's gonna try intimidate me, and I’ll just stand staring.
I don’t know who the fuck that this man thinks this man scaring.
But being overly offensive ain't really my— I'm playing,
translation: he’ll get wopped in his boat like his grandparents

You think that’s racist? I used to visit my grandad for a cup of tea.
You can't visit your grandad without a fucking fleet of submarines.
Your baby mum is peak. Guess that’s some shit she never learned before.
Your whole ancestry died on the boat, why the fuck she still got scurvy for?
She's like your great grandmum, ‘cause she a dirty whore with herpes sores,
and a bloated up guido that washed up on Jersey shore.
Further more, your kid’s ugly. Stop posting pictures with that little bitch.
She fell out the ugly tree, hit every single twig, then got pistol whipped.
I got a next bar, and the RSPCA are gonna be pissed at this,
but when she gets older, you’re gonna need a lot of makeup for that guinea pig.
No man will ever wanna be with her.
Oh wait, its a boy? That’s even worse.
It’s no surprise. Look at how that faggoty wop’s been reared.
His mum’s strang out on rock with Cadalack Ron,
and you’re just mad ‘cause she copped his gear.
She’s like the Fourth Birthday bouncer, ‘cause she got sacked from her job this year.
She went cable and they were like, “Damn, she's the nastiest dog in here.”
He’s talking shit about my son.
Those are some great bars. I mean, that was fucking great man.
I mean, what are you gonna fight him next?
I’m pretty sure you’re in his weight class.
I’m in a whole nother league, so it don’t matter what you say,
‘cause you were only good for one event: you’re like Battle of the Brave.
And I don’t want to spend the whole fucking battle
talking about this shit for half a day,
so let’s go ahead and get all this obvious shit right out of the way.

Do you wanna know what getting punched by you is really like?
Right before you hit me, I swear to god someone screamed “pillow fight”.
So you want to try again, go ahead and try it, bitch,
but I don’t know why you act violent,
especially when your tiny fists are fucking softer than dryer lint.
I’m kind of sick, dog, and I’m not into taking losses,
and I’ve never seen you fight, but you giving fucking excellent face massages.
You mention the fucking punch every battle. Okay, that's enough.
He’s so fucking proud of that cheap shot; you brave little cunt.
Then you fucking turned tail and ran like a bitch
‘cause I wasn't phased by the punch;
luckily for you, I know how to be the bigger man, in more ways than one.
You tried to save Jeff and you made him look weak.
You gave me your best punch and I ate that shit like a G.
If I could go back in time, I wouldn't change a thing
‘cause I’m willing to bet, if the shoe was on the other foot,
I bet that little Jeffy P wouldn’t hesitate to do the same thing to me.
That’s real shit. That’s why I’m killing this faker.
See, violence ain’t the only way that you can deal with a hater.
See, you’ve barely broke a hundred thousand views in your life,
and just to keep it real with you, player,
if I would’ve hit you back, you would’ve woke up a fucking million views later.
Look at this shit; you see that?
That’s just like your whole style, dog, it’s just fucking smoke and mirrors.
If you would’ve never hit me back then, nobody would even know you’re here.
I dictated your next move; I’m your evil overseer.
Kim Jong-un: I’ve got power over Seoul, Korea(Soul Career).
If I ever see you in the States, then I’m dropping his ass.
I’m known to dissect motherfuckers like a biology class.
I got a snub thirty-eight that’ll body this fag,
and I keep that shit on my waist like a colostomy bag.
And I forgot one, but I don’t give a fuck, ‘cause I’ll let the pistol smoke.
I’ll leave you floating in a river, bro.
My guns got a secret they promised not to tell a living Soul.
He said he’s got power over Seoul like Kim Jong-un. That’s the shit that he on, man?
Bruv, King Jong-un’s for North Korea. You should know that from your peon gang.
Arsonal and Verb are the two big names who have faced him
and both times, that was you replacing Shotty ‘cause he couldn't make it.
So if you ever think your’e ever fucking getting the chain,
that’s cute, but the only time the staff ever mention your name
is when Gully’s like,
"Some say Shotty isn't gonna show up, and that’s what the talk is about,”
and Organik’s like “Fuck. Is caustic around?
Well its clear… What we do here...
is take back the deposit that’s down in Shotty’s account, cause it to bounce,
then book the cokehead racist for a quarter of the amount.”
Now thats unfair… but you still there...
because you’re a clown, obviously down,
thick any chance you get
to call black people moolies without them knocking him out.
Bruv, you and Cadalack Ron have the exact same fan base.
He's like, “Come on, how can I have hate for a man’s race?
Some of my best friends wear black face.”
So when your klan mates had the word, they were pissed, G.
Heard what happened in Atlanta, that you got turned into mincemeat.
Ain’t them the ones normally that light crosses and burn Mississippi?
Then how the fuck’s the racist the one getting burned by a Big T?
Look, you called Big T a chunky monkey. Are you dumb?
Then you called John John a slave. Bruh, that’s too much.
Well you're in inner city London; they gon rush him, man, this dude’s fucked.
Open up those old wounds, they'll open up some new ones.
Listen, I talked to the rapper that sold you coke last time he was in this town.
He said he was looking at you like you look at Big T.
“Shit, that guy’s three-hundred-odd pounds.”
Then you said you wanted a discount? With what he'd snort up his snout?
If he gave you three percent off, he'd have to remortgage his house.
I'm saying nobody can take blow like their noses can.
Thrown out the club, and he don't play Kotal Khan.
He had to change soda brands, ‘cause he bought bare Cola cans,
and not one single one of them would share coke with Dan.
You said your homie sold me coke; that’s just amusing to me.
I mean, have you ever fucking met me in your life?
Everybody knows I only do it if it’s free.
You clearly not the tough guy that you clearly pretended to be.
I’ll never accept defeat from some little weirdo with yellow teeth.
We may be cool tomorrow, but tonight, I’m here as your enemy.
I only came to cross the line like Syrian refugees.

Nice overbite, Shorty Spice.
Why you picking on me for? Maybe you want to try someone more your size.
He’s the cheap victory type. I know the type.
He’s the sort of guy that picks Oddjob every time on GoldenEye.
No proximity mines, he goes straight for the golden gun stage.
I met you before; I know this fuckface.
Are you this ugly all the time, or you going through a rough phase?
You got Kurt Cobain’s hair and Courtney Love’s face.
So it’s Fresh Coast. Your pen game - less dope.
Real men don’t watch Death Note.
Your whole persona’s based on some Japanese kids’ show.
Little bitch, I bet you get your hair done by Fresco.
What’s it like being a bitch, dog? I’m asking for a friend.
He writes a couple bars about cartoons and he’s a savage with the pen,
so, welcome to another episode of “Anime with Jed”.
Or maybe he’s gonna tell us about the time he went to Canada.. again.
Oh, and you made a friend. Oh, he’s in a long-distance relationship.
Be honest, bro, how fucking stupid do you feel every time you say that shit?
No? They’re called groupies, dog,
you aren’t supposed to wife them up and date the bitch.
The only reason he even still talks to Organik
is ‘cause he can’t afford to pay for trips.
Don’t you find it strange as shit that you and you girl’s whole relationship
is based on whenever the next World Domination is?
You’re five foot three, with fucked up teeth; who wouldn’t want to get with you?
I mean it’s Jed Mitchell.
His girlfriend blew more guys in ninety minutes than a Chelsea ref whistle.
He still try to tell people that he’s really the headliner.
Just ‘cause you lost to Cee Major doesn’t mean it’s okay to F Minors.
Oh, you don’t like it when I talk about your girl. What you staring at, bitch?
She’s sixteen years old, you can’t marry that bitch.
Every rapper in Toronto been sharing that bitch.
I will EMC / Mac Sherry that bitch.
You can’t cross the threshold; you can’t carry that bitch.
I got a Glock nineteen and I carry that bitch.
I will Ol’D.B. / Mariah Carey that bitch.
I will Bruce Almighty Jim Carey that bitch.

If you buy into his shit, then you’re basically an idiot.
You’re talking about the shit I did; let’s talk about what I didn’t, bitch.
I didn’t switch on Arcane to get in with Diz; that’s snitchy shit.
I didn’t bullied into a Twitter bitch; that’s bitchy shit.
I didn’t think, “I’ll battle my good friend, then bring up his
dead homie, then shit my fucking pants when he say he’ll split my shit.”
That’s all bitch-made shit he did since our little incident,
but he wants to call me a little bitch? For swinging fists? That’s ridiculous.
“Aw, my daddy died when I was five.” Yeah, no fucking shit he did.
You wouldn’t be such a fucking spineless faggot if he lived.
Mister “it’s just words, it’s just words,” to cover up his ignorance,
then spit some shit sniffling, voice quivering; you’re a hypocrite.

But no doubt your kid’ll grow up fucking well-adjusted,
fucking weekend dad taking him out in the car that he’s selling drugs in.
Can’t take him on holiday ‘cause you know you won’t get through customs,
but you can get busted
cheating on your wife the same day you battled Jeff in London.
Oh… This shit just got incredibly real.
Bruv, you want me to list off all the named that you attempt to conceal?
Talk about that phone call at Bam’s house; turn into the wrestling heel?
That’s what faggots like you do. This is real-life incredibly real.
This is your daddy being dead to you real.
Growing up without a father, and how you’re still effected by it real.
Being too young to even fucking make sense of it real;
doing the same shit to the kid that you’re a blessing to real.
Now that’s depressingly real.
Think about it: no father figure, juvenile detention appeals,
now you’re grown-up, weapons to peel, fucking heroine deals,
trying to avoid that second possession-with-intent sentence appeal.
I’ll do you one better: growing up with a fucking single mother prepping his meals.
Growing up with the same scars you have that never would heal.
Well, that was fucking amazing. Look at this fucking guy, he’s literally shaking.
I mean, I think he only choked ‘cause he got nervous trying to picture me naked.
I wrote the book on this disrespect shit, dog. ‘Bout to open a chapter.
Cold as Alaska. Four-four leave your fucking dome in the rafters.
This is the final testament for anyone who said Soul been a factor.
Nah. Everything I write Will get money left behind, now that’s a sole benefactor.
Can’t fuck with me. Roll publicly with cold cutlery,
might get yourself stuck-up for acting so uppity.
No touching me; my whole company roll up with me.
Soul stole Loe’s whole flow so comfortably.
Claiming you fathered the style when you don’t even got sole(Soul) custody.
And your hoe knows what’s up with me. Tell that bitch I got some sperm to swallow.
You ‘bout to get knocked out your Timeline,
and not to Mention I got your Bird to follow.
This Soul faggot’s been acting sick; he’s not coming into work tomorrow,
or ratchets like Volkswagens: the death of Jed’ll(Jetta) be a German model.
All you talk about is The fucking Wire, every battle.
That’s where you get your little criminal raps;
his hero’s Omar, gay gangster that took dick in his ass.
You may be the champ over here, but to me, you a rookie still.
I’m more of a Sopranos guy. Talking through the wire ‘ll get this Big Pussy killed.
And now, unfortunately, there’s something I got to mention, y’all.
I mean, Soul always been on the up and up,
but after I saw this, I had to second guess him, y’all.
Somebody linked me to a post that you posted on a forum
and I can’t help but read it all,
where you went into detail about how you suffer from depression
and one day you almost tried to end it all.
What kind of depression? Could you picture him crying and stressing?
Giving all kinds of confessions to some licensed physician inside of sentence;
I swear to god,
every time you’ve attempted suicide it’s just another cry for attention,
but I find it pathetic,
‘cause there’s no such thing as a suicide attempt.
You either wanted to die or you didn’t.
You got problems with your life? Just accept that shit.
You crying about suicide online? I don’t get that shit.
Kill your fucking self. I don’t respect that shit.
Go somewhere and shoot your fucking self like a webcam bitch.
Your fate’s already been decided.
I mean the whole thought process behind it, it’s weak-minded.
I suggest you fucking fucked up the first time, then you re-try it.
If the noose slipped, then you get back on the chair and you re-tie it.
So why you talking to me?
I mean, you proved three years ago you ain’t boxing with me.
You almost bodied yourself, you’re supposed to body me?
Next time you try to kill yourself,
remember, it’s down the road, not across the street.
You are fucking pathetic. Pity party for one.
Go ahead and go home to your home Fife,
‘cause that whole fight says a lot about you, bro;
you’ve been running from your problems your whole life.
There’s nothing wrong with being a felon that’s proud of his skin type.
Ask Miklo. I may be white on the outside, but I’m brown on the inside.
You don’t compare to Ron.
I seem sleazy, but this scene needs me.
Me and G.T. go together like slamming coke and hero-on.
I’m more gangster than a O.G. parolee O.D.ing,
watching a whole season of Gangland marathon.
Well what do you know? It’s that kid from the message boards.
I never noticed, but I know this:
your nose is almost as stretched as most of your metaphors.
You’re an awkward blog nerd, hoping to be the dude that got Ron.
If you got served by Okwerdz, you’d brag about it on Rapmusic dot com.
Lush, you didn’t tell me this was a two-on-one battle; that’s scandalous, bro,
‘cause I can easily dismantle your flows, but I don’t know if I can handle that nose.
CAUSTIC
Cadalack doesn’t have a lot of black friends,
‘cause usually the first impression is bad.
But it doesn’t help that your car’s registered tags are small Confederate flags,
which is strange, ‘cause your voice sounds like your imitating a Mexican man.
Even your white supremacist dad said that you robbed Rheteric bad.
Which reminds me: Dear Diary,
it’s Ron again. Over the summer I got into extreme dieting.
I find drugs like speed enlightening,
not to mention the fact that it makes me run at the speed of lightning.
When the police chase me now it’s not even frightening,
and when I sleep on the sidewalk I can’t even feel the mosquitos bite me.
It’s been hard to raise money for drugs since my parents cut me off entirely;
I had a job selling used cars for my dad, but he fired me.
Okay, I have to go now; it’s getting hard for me to keep writing these,
‘cause I only get fifteen minutes on the computer in the library.
See that? Homeless people are easy targets. You probably sleep in a park so often,
after this the Bar Exam squadron’s going to have to bury you in a cardboard coffin.
Look at this hockey team reject.
I’m the biggest monster you’ve seen yet. You got no offensive reflex.
So when I sock him in the face and the blood gets his beak wet,
don’t sweat. It’s won’t matter; he’s sponsored by Kleenex.
You’re the fake impostor version of Real Deal, with Soul Khan’s nose.
At the last gurp-out, I laid some lines out,
and this motherfucker’s nostrils stole Ron’s blow.
Whoa. How does that shnoz even sit on kid’s face?
How do you keep your head straight, and what’s your strategy
from keeping your center of gravity from having to be displaced?
Everyone knows this bitch is a big fake, you Union City disgrace,
so I guess it’s no mistake you didn’t get any space on the new Fresh Coast mixtape.
Fuck a mixtape, you never made a real CD.
He used to practice his thizz face
just in case he fulfilled his dreams of being on Treal TV.
Everything they say is true. I been making moves and paying dues
ever since you were in skater shoes practicing your Mortal Kombat Raiden moves.
You worship H.T., bitch. After this you’re probably going to buy us some beers.
How you going to diss the Hockey Team?
It looks like you’ve been hitting the fucking ice for years.
Yeah, you got some quotes,
but the fact that you go to Narcotics Anonymous is a joke.
How come when somebody offers you dope,
you can’t control yourself like a responsible adult?
You dropped out of Hollywood High, to walk around Hollywood high.
If any of y’all got a blowjob on Santa Monica Drive, it was probly a guy.
Your parents said your intervention was an embarrassing arrangement,
‘cause halfway through it you fell asleep on the stairs,
naked, with nothing but your hair for a blanket.
When the Jungle starts shooting people up, watch Ron get excited.
You fucking junkie, let’s just hope they amputate the arm that you write with.
Welcome to the league, faggot. You’re now rapping with the finest.
This dumb fuck learned his A-B-C’s from contracting hepatitis.
And when will this mutant realize that it’s the heroine melting down your face?
You’re a grownup now, Ron, it’s time to wear your fucking belt around your waist.
Are you fucking kidding me?
How does it feel to know your last battle was one of the worst in Fresh Coast history?
I’m savage. You’re average. Your rapping’s
like trying to get a package on Sunday: you’ve got no delivery.
‘Cause you want to be top tier so bad, dog. You hardly even tough.
I swear, watching you and Mic Phenom battle
was worse than watching retarded people fuck.
You style burglar, I’m a child murderer: I kill wack kids.
How come the best line you had in that battle was a reference to Illmac’s jizz?
No matter how much bitch shit this dickless kid spits,
this linguistic misfit’ll slit his wrists quicker than breakfast grits
missing Bisquick with extra swiftness.
Listen; let’s get specific. His whole existence is fictitious.
A living wish list to be the switch-hit mistress of Kid Twist in his bitch’s lipstick.
Stick to your other interests, like kick-flips, ‘cause on the spit tip,
you’ll get dismissed by this sadistic twisted whiz kid
when I rip this infant wide open like rich kids and gifts on Christmas.
You got the oldest fill-ins. That’s no one’s feeling.
Plus, you look like Owen Wilson if a cobra bit him in the throat and killed him.
This the only Cadalack that takes keys in his ass.
The reason is that, I don’t mean speakers and amps
when I say he puts twelves in his trunk and gets beat from the back.
You look like Stevie Nicks ‘cause in the Year of the Rat
your dad bought a 1973 Grand Marquis in green and black
and you were conceived in the back.. to Fleetwood Mac.
You ain’t hard at all, sipping up forties of Armor-All with your homies from art class.
Y’all think this phony’s a hard match? Bitch, show me the Carfax.
Okay, I get it, you’re a talking car. But KITT from Night Rider rhymes tighter,
and anybody who’s ever recognized you thinks you’re Existereo’s driver.
You just can’t stop me, Ronny. There’s no way I’m getting fucked over,
not until I prove this jalopy’s just an overrated cupholder.
You had it good in L.A., Ron,
but the drugs they’ve been feeding you made you fucking inferior.
So what’s the good of owning a Cadillac if you fucked up the interior?
Let’s put all these suckas dodging Lyt in one circle.
You who I got to bite next for sho, Red.
So I brought a perfect round for this bloodsucker, O Red.
What’s popping, B? I hear you popping, B.
Well where I’m from, even stars get a round for that flag: thirteen colonies.
That’s food for thought on your plate, O(Plato). Socrates with philosophy.
Keep it going? I kick that shit: soccer cleat.
Keep it going? Any rapper I de-feat, Wu Tang, that mean I’m Wallabee.
Keep it going? Grape street, my Mobb Deep, causing Havoc, the prouder G(Prodigy).
It take one eye to see(Odyssey), even the oddest see I— you be killing me.
When you rap, the shit sound like a soliloquy.
You very’ Pat Stay: you out your cotton-picking mind thinking you whipping me.
It’s three rounds; your three stories won’t make you triller, G(trilogy).
Chicago. Y’all ready for me to kill this geek?
Say no more. Let’s rock, Davone. Hope you like Papa John’s,
‘cause tonight that’s what you eating, and I’m treating.
Bitch you hear what I’m speaking but you ain’t peeping it. Can I translate it for him?
That mean if you try angles(triangles) in your rounds you’ll get boxed;
Red rounds over the top, I’ll pepperoni your piece of(pizza).

Hold on. Ain’t Kannon on the team you with?
Well I’m just saying, when I snapped in Chiraq he had a front seat to it.
How it’s me you get? I see the shit. Devious. Paul paid me to get Peter picked.
Ironic how your team’ll get freezing stiff when that heater lift.
Have every Grape here(hair) on lock; Wiz Khalifa shit.
That shotty have bodies looking like cheetah print.
Your team ain’t cut too solid, so when they see your caesar split, them C’s ‘a split.
Rican clip: I’ll bend day.
For the mucho dinero or pesos, fuego. Ay dos mío, I can see in Day. Comprende?
(Cortez got that.) This toon fucked. Hentai.
If Red face you here(hair), I’ll crack a(cracka) battle rapper with a Bigg K.
One through the middle of this weak(week) nigga.
Fuck up your winds, Day(Wednesday).
Got to aim six inches below the target when the shit spray.
The chopper(chop a) half of a foot off: Kunta Kinte.
I’ll bag cans for your six pack. I’m Corona Lite
with a Carol Anne clip, that mean that shit’ll go in Lyt, no Poltergeist.
I’ll take his blade, hold it tight, and stab you with your homie knife,
if you don’t jet, I(jedi), use Lyt saber, I’m Yoda nice.
Tonight, I’m a demon,
dropping thirty. This gon be rack, tree-oh, I’m making Day lie(De La), Souls is leaving.
A pair of docs you’ll be needing for the paradox of me squeezing.
Meaning if I spit a round, you’ll catch it and be sleeping.
This magazine that I got National Geographic:
headshot from the Lama for the issue. Push his beak in(beacon),
Send Lyt to the sky. I’m just trying to get a signal. Official. His life deaded.
Acting dizzy in the dome, I’ll put a bullet in Day’s(daze),
now heaven’s gate is where Lyt headed(lightheaded).
Nah, you ain’t make me mad, I’m sorry, my nigga. I just got to do you bad.
Since you Spawn and I’m dog, it’s only right that I Spaz.
You’ll get shot in front your son, king. When that burner bang,
leave a grape splattered all over his Prince. What’s that? Purple Rain.
I call this shit “kicks on fire”. That mean it’ll break a sneaker down.
December 12th, my ass. This chrome eight releasing now.
Hell Rell in the booth: that Ruga spitting.
Y’all know what that mean? If one fly, son die. His son cry. No euphemisms.
That youth ‘ll miss him.
If dis appear to Day, you gon disappear today.
I’ll turn him to a ghost, and it’s evident, I’m talking clear as Day.
I’ll give him a long sub for trying to be the hero.
Violator one, Spawny boy zero.
Lately they’ve been saying my career on thin ice. I’ma show y’all Gretzky back.
I need y’all to do me one favor. Just one favor. Be completely quiet and let me rap.
This gon be one fine ass slumping. Think wine glass bumping:
let’s suppose I toast men.
Nah, I ghost them; nah, I goes in, the most in.
Shit start to get Bad, Boy,
another King getting boxed off top like they brought Los in.
Posting. I’m too creative; creative postering. I’ll be the host and
I attach to the body for growth; it’s gross but I grows the motion.
Ran, step, we coast through ocean where they host the boats and
you want to bridge, thinking my style just appeared
when I’m crystal clear like they brought Bose in.
Enough of the boasting. You decode it? I’m colder than below ten.
For those who want to B.A. Master, I’m degrees higher.
Sire. Fire as hell if I let the flow sin.
A one hundred percent perfect Day, and in that case, you get no win(d).
Lyt for the pick, see the omen. Oh, men, let’s bring some hope in.
They hoping I’m open to test O pen.
I’m going for the skunk, the monk who became Peter Punker, punk all you Uncs.
I’m where the show been; still I slow end
any career that think I ain’t a real nigga. I’m Quill, nigga. Come and provoke, then.
Think a Chinese going bankrupt: you’ll wake up with a broke Chin.
I told you, I will(wheel) have lines if they spoke pen. I go for the clear body like I won’t cloak skin.
They said, “Day, you should be careful versus the red Street Fighter.”
I reply, “all-you-can(ah-yuken) get flame.” Now let that soak in (so Ken).

Shit like that is why I’m past these peons by eons.
Me, I’m like, wherever O be, we on Trice.
He gon say he..
Peep the line; it’s the sleepy sign. Nigga, I’m beyond(be yawn) crazy;
the best to be is my Destiny, Child. The flow beyond say(Beyonce) he;
‘bout to catch a humongous body. That hoe beyond Gracie’s.
Nigga, what the talk ‘bout in this talk bout? I don’t cop out like the police.
I took money on the house but I don’t show lease.
Look at his body gestures. His cloth probably highly polyester. Yes sir.
But I’m just up here rocking the gold fleece.
Mean guys get clean fried; I use no grease.
Pack the rhymes; never slack with lines, but let the flow crease.
Snacks aside, this cat Devone; to get the mass, never go yeast.
You took this match for a body gain, but wait(weight), you lost.
And they was all telling me O beast(obese).
You got large pounds, nigga? Die it(diet) down.
Think it’s a wedding scene how I’m wetting things.
I’m the best author. One through your chest(Chess), partner; I let it Steam(s).
The last nigga I pulled the nina out on, I told him I bet it sting.
I treat that bitch like getting a call from your side bitch
when you with your main bitch: I silence her, then let it ring.
Let’s lift the quota high for O to get the show to start.
Aw, Homie, son snapping: get a load of Bart.
It could be double the animals in one room, but I still know a(Noa) mark.
A chess pawn. They said I was just drawing; I’m showing art.
You don’t hand over the bread(Bret) brother, bullets ‘ll hit O in(Owen) heart(Hart).
Round one, I’m trying to show y’all how I don’t care.
You knew I would go for the plain(plane) body ‘cause O here(O’Haire).
I’m back in Chicago with a .45 for a mirror match.
That’s a double entendre; you caught it, clown?
You vers’ the iron; you from Jordan Downs? Well I’m Jordan down.
Known to burn fat. What that mean? That mean I scorch a pound.
Cannon drumming on them niggas in purple: Morris Brown.
Now he doing all of that fool clown shit but yet and still,
you be talking ‘bout sucking dick when you Twittering.
And misspelling half of your words. Sheer ignorance.
A gay battle rapper who can’t spell? I get the shit.
You a double entendre for Ill-literate. Shit.
I knew you couldn’t be straight. Your tat crooked.
Fuck around and get a hate crime charge for this ass whooping.
Body shot, jab, hook him, he drop, the strap push him.
Leave that extra shit on his lap top: I’ll Macbook him.
Ass whoopings, I Dish On Demand. Signal, and sat a Lyt(satellite).
Savage life. Farooq, Bradshaw, you’re a actor, Lyt(acolyte).
I’m havoc-like. Static, I’ll draw, blood. Flabotomy.
That mag bust, your ass fucked from what’s on the side of me, you copy me?
Shit get Jazzy Pha when the G arrive.
Produce a hit for the Ciara featuring Petey Pab.
Just to feed the squad. Even my Mrs. love it how I turn bodies to mini-pies.
I’m cut-throat: Sweeney Todd. My fleet street; this the demon side.
Now pay attention, folks, ‘cause if he cross that intersection,
in a second his inner section get intercepted.
Then flame his bitch; make his heart burn, no indigestion.
Think him in a year: when I pick the weapon, Smith and Wesson,
face shot ate(eight) Day’s off with the .357.
If you didn’t catch it, don’t even stress it. Here go the quickest lesson.
I said, “think him in a year.” So y’all tell me, how many days in a year?
365, right? So if I pick a weapon, what’s left if I ate days off? Three fifty seven.
Bang. That pipe clap, lay his homie type flat.
Body him, then I’m at Quill next(neck). Nice tat.
Shots pop like a thot giving insight to his chick.
What that mean? That mean that ratchet’ll end Lyt and(enlighten) his bitch.
I’m sick. When I write my three, my bars hits like a shotty banging.
Every word crafted for the kill; I’m speaking body language.
Your three? Two be ehhh, the other you be going dumb.
But that means you only fire one round, like a golden gun.
Y’all want to hear some trill facts? He got advantages this match.
Chiraq want to hear me snap. They’re just hoping that you rap.
You got to put on a mask to spit that crack.
How Suge say it, Surf? I’m a real goon; I wear that ski mask like a hat.

Nah, matter fact, fuck that. I could spit flame without the mask, nigga. I’m Scorpion.
I’ll pistol whip his ass with a ratchet. Swing that forty in.
Right(write) across(a cross) on his forehead, like I’m anointing him.
Reverse Kemp: the forty bang after it point at him.
Want to hear know funny shit?
Before he lost his way in this battle culture, all you Quill fanatics wasn’t on no fan shit.
But now he top five on y’all shit, off straight trolling and Instagram pics.
I just don’t understand it, the irony.
How a nigga with no logical progression progressing off some antics(semantics).
Off that alone, that’s why I got to slump him tonight.
Kannon told me I had him, I was up for a fight.
Turned Gandhi for forty nights: I did nothing but write(right).
Neo when he lost his sight: I see nothing but Lyt(light). And his wife.
She try saving you, the nine get to spitting.
You gon need a miracle for Davone intervention.
I’m Agent Smith. Mr. Anderson gon remember me.
When I murder his father, son, and holy spirit.
He ain’t even catch that, that’s his Trinity.
Third verse, I swear I’m going hard on your chick,
with no remorse. I’ma leave a bullet lodged in her shit.
It’s gon be like both of Trinity’s death scenes. Wanna know why?
He gon have to pull that round out her body; I’ma putting bars through that bitch.
Ya heard me? Jersey.
Soon as they put me on this damn flyer they knew I’d hand fire.
A torch is what I got to show this guy.
O demise. My perception is inception: the dream is something I control.
You’ll see the four, then sky(folding sky). We hold ‘em high, then O, then sigh.
I been chasing O since ’07, now I double O seven times. Do I gotta reload the line?
Chasing O since oh-seven, double oh seven, hold ‘em high,
let ‘em go, then I(GoldenEye)
become flight Lyt, I go for the plain(plane) body, skip the departure signs.
Partner, this part’s surprise; part ya, arrow to get arch torture, we cart your lives;
I black on one in a Million, Man, but I don’t got Marching pride.
I just want confirmation for this type(-)writing.
One day they gon let a author rise(authorize). I never card decline.

I just swag hard on these bad fathers;
only other option is for you to get dead(-)beat.
You still don’t get what my M.O.s is?(Moses)
Well this the part where Red see(Red Sea).
A brother with Flubber kits: I get green out of control.
Don’t stutter shit if a brother slip.
I make B rest, feeding you this formula.
These babies gon realize I’m on some (m)other shit.
I swag flyer; cash higher; just flow, Escrow, the pad buyer.
Your man win; I get a mansion(man chin) bigger than Quagmire’s.
Wait, but let me remind y’all. These slimeballs can’t define god.
They die hard soon as the Tom call their bluff,
but I come tough as McGruff; this shit is a crime, dog.
Whether you get smoked or not, you can’t decline forward.
The blind fall soon as they call shots.
Mutumbo vs Air Bud: finger wave after dog block.
I’m all Watts. Any kid with the can get hard knocked.
All Watts. Every nigga on my team a animal: we Starfox.
But Red, this is why I’m ahead of y’all. I ain’t scared of y’all. I don’t duck. What?
Big Pun, Fat Joe: I’ll tear a squad(Terror Squad) the fuck up.
But this a case where you out(-)classed. Too much time tardy spent.
I got the job done when I have to face the higher(hire).
Soon as the coin toss for shorty, it was Harvey Dent.
They should’ve told you you would have to face the fire.
But if he play buster, we’ll do it the G way. The streets say rush ya.
Make three simple sounds and get beat crazy: DJ Mustard.
Round two, before I got hot as the Devil with this shit,
I tell all you rap niggas, it’s levels to this shit.
Let’s clap it up for Davone Campbell,
‘cause this the second time he ain’t bring that bullshit where the Bulls play.
Your round was actually better than the words that I thought you would say.
Wordplay, punches, schemes, you was spitting shit the hood way.
You nice, dude. Ice Cube: today was a good Day.
But at the same time, it’s a sad night. I’m past nice.
This where my bars school Day’s(School Daze), this G on your head, Half-Pint.
You ab, Lyt, when I’m addressing, you lose, wait(weight). This the craft, Lyt.
I’m trying to get you shine. Just a flash, Lyt.
Not the vast light, ‘cause I’ll expose a lot of your messy shit if I black, Lyt.
I watched you take the penmanship, style, angles, antics..
fuck, even the movements of Lux.
Small burger, lettuce, tomatoes: you’re a junior to Lux(Junior Deluxe).
When you rap, I envision Oprah and Danny Glover fucking.
Oh y’all ain’t even catch it, I said that mean when I look at you, I see Beloved.
You dressed up like a slave, my nigga. And lost to a white man on a battle rap offramp.
Then you had a second chance vers’ Iron and got your ass tore. That’s facts.

That was a free head shot though.
How you dressing up like Twelve Years a Slave and couldn’t manage to put Solomon north up?
Chicago, I told Kannon, “Quit with the tough words you fuck nerd, nigga.
You make Chicago look bad: you a Yung Berg nigga.”
But this fag? He hurting all of our swag. He a butt plug nigga.
You make hip hop look bad. You a Young Thug nigga.
Choppa drop him, make him brush that canvas, that’s how I paint the pic.
Hit nothing but Lyt; from this range, I’m all Day with it.
Banana clip break your shit. I’ll lift, get to waving it,
You’ll get stretched next(necks) from the rings when I bring that K in(Kayan), bitch.
Kayan tribe, Google it; that bar was some amazing shit.
Fifty round drum that’ll turn swine to bacon bits.
That Tom knock the air out a pig(’s) skin. That’s a Patriot.
The single barrel shotgun, that shit built like a curtain rod.
Gauge, twenty shells. That mean from that 20-12, his Earth ‘ll die.
This faggot nigga at the wake, shirt and tie, front row, sure to cry.
I’ll leave Lyt’s spirit bodied if I merk her, bye. Merkaba. Google it; that bar’s certified.
That mean I’ll shoot your broad, Daylyt, in broad daylight, blaze her with the gun.
If you Play in Chicago, my shit raising(Raisin) In the Sun.
That just reminded me. You actually said you would fuck Diddy? You a motherfucking lame, mu.
A faggot who 103rd flagging, what’s that? A grape fruit.
Me aim shoot, leave his cage loose, and sent him to Jesus
with a Great Bambi-no, I’ma hit your Babe Ruth.
I’ll push her shit back like Stephen. You know, an A. Smith,
and make you leave without your bitch, you’ll Skip bae-less(Bayless).
I’m great with the glock and the pound; I could Matrix, or late switch.
Nine to five will make a Day shift. Amazing. Give me room. This Day’s end(Inn).
Think he winning? Know what’s amazing?
He came to Chicago, and stole my Big T O-beast bar.
No wonder he think he winning this.
‘Cause the nigga he mimicking, even mimicking Red rhymes.
Vers’ Charlie, Lux did that Ben Stiller shit. You know, the shit he said? Mine.
Pay attention, homo. The proof is in his logo.
But I get it. You can be Beloved Two. Just use a couple of Red lines.
This shit is gon be nasty on the net. I’m talking porn site.
‘Cause most of y’all ain’t get half of this round on-site.
It’s for the people on site.
I did this for the fans on the W.E.B. that’s loving what the boy write.
I’m Floyd-like. He’s just another nigga smoked.
Billy Gruff: it’s always a troll fucking with the goat.
I swear to god on my momma, if it wasn’t for the gwala,
I wouldn’t even bother. But y’all know what they say, right?
Another Day, another dollar.
Jersey.
What I did in my third round versus Ooops, I’d like to call this the sequel.
Fact that I’ma talk about my family, and then I’ma talk to my people.
Look on the news; look what they do to our people as a whole.
I get it. The plot is not as simple, see,
them cops find the right block to plant the right rock
which keep us divided with buying entities.
Divide and conquer. But we built for that street life, riding like it was meant to be,
but I get it. They got us fucked up physically,
and then they got us fucked up mentally,
with something called cerebral fear. Example number one:
it could be six niggas at a dope house, one got a chopper, one got a rocket launcher,
one got a A.R., one got a nina, and one nigga got a tall gun.
Let one police hit the corner with one snub nose .357,
and all six of them niggas all run.

The question is why. But if it was a black nigga, they ready to start the ruckus,
bunch of Uncle Ruckuses.
But they don’t do shit when the cops steady bothering kids.
It’s funny how all these niggas say they got beef baking(bacon),
but none of them willing to slaughter the pigs.
But I get it. You play gangster on the stage. Damn. He style thugging.
His boys with the business, too. His family wild bugging.
Make up your mind. You with the shit, or with your knot. Damn, he wild gunning.
We don’t know if you a man or a bitch: Sammy Wild 100s.
But I get it. Nobody want to do nothing, huh.
The last nigga that played King, they popped his dream.
How we gon ask for justice for Mike Brown? Justice for Trayv-
nigga, we still ain’t got justice for Rodney King.
We can play gangster all we want. But ourself is who we lying to.
We claim to be pit bulls, but to the police, we Family Guys, dog. Brian, dukes.
If any one of y’all niggas ready to go out in the streets
and war it out with the police, then I am too.
You’ll find a battle rapper marching up the street
with the can, sir(cancer). I am Ooops.
But the cops really got us so scared, like, scared than a motherfucker.
Like, every time I cut on the news I’m like, “Damn, look what these guys done done.”
I’m so afraid of the police, I could be in the middle of getting robbed,
and debate if I should call 9-1-1.
I mean, the fact is, if I’m getting robbed, the worst thing that can happen to me
is a nigga take my clothes, I fall to the ground, one of them boot a nigga,
or I could call the police, they show up,
don’t know who robbing who and just start shooting niggas.
But enough with the positive shit.
Shit been looking a little shaky. For this crowd, I came in a rattle.
Last time I was here, I had a crack rock so big, Ill tried to drag it home.
This time, I got a crack rock so big, Yung Ill came to the battle.
Google that. Google if Yung Ill was here.
Your fans say you the best ever, 'cause you dangerous with different stuff.
Your charisma is unmatched; you make the crowd wanna listen up.
You got killer angles, deadly freestyles, and your writtens tough;
that's partly why fans gave you the wins over Clips & Lux,
but I don't give a fuck. Tell me, why is he so elite?
Wait a minute. I thought this was Hollow. Y'all got me battling Tony D?
A nigga with a whole first name, but his last name is only D?
Well, I don't give a fuck, y'all getting the same Jones from me.
Eurgh, why you amp him up? I'm back, with the cannon tucked,
It's Loaded, spitting Hollow rounds like the Black Panther Lux.
Remember this?
"As far as bars, he's a poor man version of Chilla Jones' stuff.”
Well, I'm glad Shotty caught on.
It was clear from your very first battle in this artform.
Truth: that's word to the pad you copied bars on;
you been biting heads right off the bat like Ozzy Osbourne.
Tell your posse, get they mob on? Shit, it's whatever.
You ain’t a G. You soft as a Dutch sweater, with plush texture.
Just estrogen. Why your thug’s extra with tough gestures?
If it's hype(-)’r(-)tension, I'll squeeze arms and have a Blood press(-)ya.
Surgeons pulling fragments out your chest where the slug entered,
now everything coming from the heart like a love letter.
Whoever praise ya better save ya, ‘cause you ain't got a trey to blam.
Think graffiti: Tony gon get it shaking before he spray the can,
or turn bitch. That’s how you switch agenda(gender) without changing plans.
Son gon see pops in the ring like Shane McMahon.
I’ll shank your man. Watch where you aim the cam.
If his blood dry on the lens, they'll see Burgundy on the screen like Anchorman.

Photo by @ThatYoutJoel for Don't Flop.I know where they rank you fam. This is where your name shines;
They love you here. I don't expect cheers when it's game time,
But when they go back to their flats, and get to rewind these same lines,
Oh the irony, how you'll win at home, but, lose at home at the same time.
My frame of mind: why pick me, Tony? That choice senseless;
with 5 9s I'm Royce reckless;
I'll pistol whip everyone in your click til your boys neckless,
let it ring, then I’m coming after Tone like a voice message.
This a deathwish, My Killer Instinct is so savage, bruh.
Lyrically, I'm a Street Fighter; I scold battlers.
A Mortal (K)ombating this pen? He's no challenger.
I'm way brighter. I need a writer of Soul (C)alib(u)r,
so next year, let’s set it up. Let's get him set up for the upset.
I'll make a deal wit you: an extra buck fifty, I’ll get him cut next(cks).
I got a blade you can't stomach, money: that's a gut-check.
Sketch artist: that lead drawing ‘ll make him look suspect.
I must flex. I got a name in the States, Tony; I could ignore you.
Shotty and Soul got a name in the states, too;
look at all the work they put in for you.
After your choke vers’ Real Deal, Don't Flop is the only league booking for you.
I dont get it. Ain’t being wanted ‘posed ta(poster) have everybody looking for you?
I'm putting a whoopin on you, 'cause you battled dudes who sound like me,
but you ain't never stood in front of three rounds like these.
Bosstown.
This weekend, they assembled the greats,
so props to the staff, 'cause fans been looking at this schedule amazed.
The calibre of battle rapper that have stepped in this place,
I’m talkin legends. And we get to face some American brays.
You man are no longer setting the pace.
You've been sleeping, and whats that taught us(tortoise), if anything, mate?
Not to split hair(hare)s, but you’re no longer ahead in the race,
and Chilla, I confess it's a shame.
Your material? Denim, on a fat bitch, it stretches at strains,
and I guess in the States, that shit connect and it’s flames,
but that’s ‘cause they backwards thinking, like a trip down memory lane.
This crowd a bit more intelligent mate,
'cause This Is England. And now the script read I skin heads
like Shane Meadows setting the stage.
King pen, this the end of your reign,
'cause off top, I’m too(two) on point with the tell(tail). Ain't that a devilish trait?
For the Hell of it, straight rob you for whatever he paid,
like, “Hands up. Now back down." Look like you trying to start a Mexican wave.
How you stepped in my face when I’m at the peak of my powers?
The plan is to rain down and rock your world: that’s a meteor shower.
Mr. Jump-to-top-tier-from-the-Proving-Ground. That's old news.
‘Cause I’m Mr. If-I-spit-three-rounds-I-don’t-lose.
You tweeted you was coming here to smoke Tone’s Boots,
but no you ain’t. And that loose Tongue will get its owner Laced;
you'll need your soul(Sole) replaced, 'cause he'll get worn out, like old shoes.
You're having second thoughts now; I know you.
Wishing he never answered the call like Colin Farrell in phone booth.
On this card he act(cardiac) like trouble, that’s a code blue.
I'll split your dome into sections for entertainment like the O2.

Photo by iDJPhotography for Don't Flop.This cold proof you ain't Tone’s rapping equal.
No antics, no gimmicks. I’m plain old fashioned lethal.
Online, they over hype you, claim you toe tagging people,
but don’t force belief in false readings,
'cause they gas you more than they should like a Volkswagen diesel.
This is evil. What I’m performing is torture,
punches have you stumbling as he walks to his corner,
it’s hard labor, he’s left leaning, like a Corbyn supporter.
I’m sick. I’ve got a rhyming-when-I’m-talking disorder,
and i still can't swim. No, check the Deffinition, I’m still walking on water.
Wavy. I don’t sound like C(sea).
I only took this battle to steal your soundbite clean,
'cause you ain't never stood in front of three rounds like these.
This round, you getting fire out the gate, like hell’s entrance,
with conviction behind these bars minus the jail sentence.
Your chick, say you're a boy, and I'm a man, and that's the real difference.
You can't measure up; that's why I rule her(ruler) like twelve inches,
but, let’s use the metric system. Guess I gotta switch the plan,
Soon as I get sent to meet her(centimeter), she on her knees, unzipping pants.
You the head of the house. Well I'll kill a leader(kiloliter) when I'm clicking cans,
and if your, mums mum’s there wit’cha, I'ma hit’cha grams.
Listen fam. You tweeted he was capable of writing with Jones.
I seen ya sit us in(senior citizen) the same tier, that ain't a lie to condone.
Now I'm tight in a zone. I brought an L to leave(elderly) this old man,
‘cause he ain't know what retire meant, holmes.
But let him tell it, he aint retire. It was his career on a breather.
I came here with some ether. You prepared for a schemer.
Freddy Krueger vers’ Meek Mill: a nightmare to a Dreamer.
Grip the knife. Come get a slice like we sharing a pizza.
Ventilation how I’m airing the heater.
Or think a cabbie on a slow day, Bro: it’s no fair(fare) with the meter.
Either you should've brought your best to me, or backed out, scrap,
‘cause Eurgh done put you vers’ a steamroller. Now let's see if you can flat-out rap.
You outmatched. Y’all think he super smooth 'cause he grins a lot.
My troopers move, gripping glocks to shoot at you, them twins ‘a pop;
They sends a shot. If you came with a crew of dudes, your friends'll drop.
You survive? They switch the plot, say "Rubix cube" and spins the block.
You niggas thought 'cause of a few good battles your pens are hot?
Debatables, those are ties. We can't tell if they wins or not(windsor knot).

Photo by @iDJPhotography for Don't Flop.Defend your spot, 'cause Americans kill you when you begin to fight us,
You be on track, and then we stop your run.
Maybe that's why they tend to knight us(tendinitis).
You the king of writers?
If that's your goal, then(golden) touch the stage vers’ the one they think is Midas.
Y’all feeling(Filling) he got the Crown til the K(Decay) in his mouth like gingivitis,
but you supposed to be a pain in my side? Let’s let a pen decide this(appendicitis);
we both sick, but this a different virus. I spit the nicest, ripping cyphers,
I chews ‘em up, and spits 'em out. You chews(choose) nothing like you indecisive.
But y'all claim this nigga righteous, so Tony act pompous,
til he slip and inspect a(Spectre) clip like the Bond flick.
Rock him once, all fists. Knock him unconscious,
everybody turn and yell “Oh!”(turning yellow) like jaundice.
Y'all pick. How y'all want his ass to say goodnight?
Either shots sail(-)or see if he can navigate a right.
He tried to phone for help. In that case, he had to pay the price.
Whoever he call ‘a see him(coliseum) covered in blood like a gladiator fight.
Good night, ‘cause you battled dudes who sound like me,
but you ain't never stood in front of 3 rounds like these.
Bosstown.
I've come to expose your style, make these people wake up,
'cause you work hard to force lines, like the barber that gave DNA his shape up.
This what chilla bring to a written:
“You need a genie to defeat me and fix you winning,
I’ll throw money in a hole, well, you into wishing.
I don’t feel you, and I trust my intuition.
You're gettin schooled for a fee, you in tuition.”
Then it goes way fuckin left:
“Scratch that, I’ll make your dogs flee(flea) like they’re into itching.
Point at hat, big stick make you fly, like you into witching.
We're going Hertfordshire. After the win, to Hitchin.”
It’s that, or shitty word association got him feeling himself.
So Chilla got some nonsense schemes in store like Keenan and Kel,
and some reaches as well, but that shit easy as hell,
if you ain't even going to bother to speak how its spelt.
You're pulling wool over eyes thats what your whole career is.
I sparked a Benson, started reflecting, and it hit me: you're all smoke and mirrors.
They don’t see the deceit in the lies you bring,
but the same people claiming your rhymes will win,
same people claim Fetty Wap’s the hypest thing,
'cause In the land of the blind, the one-eyed is the king.
That shit’s a crutch, it is such simple stuff you're thinking up,
makes dumb people feel really smart, but it makes smart people feel really dumb.
If you disregard spelling in real life the way you disregard it in a battle,
you'd be shit on Countdown, Ouija boards ’d be hard for you to handle,
and you'd start a bit of hassle and cause arguments at Scrabble.
For instance peeps, listen please, and you tell me, is this a reach.
You know Pocahontas? Ratatouille?
Well, he pronounced that using different speech.
He said "poker honest" and "rat the toolie”, just to fit a Disney scheme.
“Rat the toolie,” I swear, I sat there in disbelief,
like "did he really j-“ And then the crowd cheered, and I kicked the screen.
That shit is weak. We calling it a waste man method.
Chilla reach with that Jordan in SpaceJam tekkers.
You reckless, the way you take it further.
In the spirit of Johnny Cochran, no, J(O.J.), they let you get away with murder.
What I’m fearing is the battlers and fans with less experience
are really starting to take that reach shit serious,
'cause Dot follow your sentences, full stop, period.
But they’re scheming awful bars and reaching awful hard,
but I figured Black Thought will expose The Roots 'cause that’s when Things Fall Apart.
‘Cause you don’t stand up to scrutiny. You probe and find
that what you kick is air, like Bigg K reacting to an opponent’s rhyme.
I won't deny it’s funny to me that you’ve got an overbite
when your performance sucks 'cause its got no teeth like Obie Trice.
They know I’m nice, so me catching this body come as no surprise.
They fucked with me since Double P was part of Tony’s life.
I came out the hood spitting poison: that’s a cobra strike.
Now i hold my own, no fucks given: that’s a lonely night.
And you can't see me and I’m fucking up this room: that’s a poltergeist.
It’s over, time.
I heard you paid a London chap to scrape up dirt for you,
a VIP ticket in exchange for some made-up personals.
But them lies wont hold weight, they'll make it straight up worse for you,
and I designed every line in this round perfect for hurting you.
I heard a few things and I was taken aback from that,
so this round I’m breaking you down, no punching back to back.
Now we criticized T-Rex for being a nurse that be packin straps,
well newsflash. Turns out T-Rex isn't the only nurse in battle rap.
As Tony D, you be putting on for London, making the city happy.
As a nurse, you was putting on.. scrubs, and changing shitty nappies.
As Tony D,  you was the champ, and nobody could get rid of ya.
As a nurse, you was amped.. to take old ladies to the cinema.
Give it a rest, bruv. You the softest Tony ever. You think a G bluffing?
Tony Scarface was a thug and drug dealer that kept keys running,
Tony Soprano was a mob boss that had everyone in the streets duckin,
but Tony D, a 36 year old black nurse outta East London.
You fucking snake. Now let me expose how you double crossed.
Flex hit you for you versus Raptor. He even put Gemini on the undercard.
He told Flex, Eurgh wanted the same battle on a summer card,
but he would do it on Flex’s platform 'cause he ain't fuck with y'all.
Am I lying? Look at the reaction on this nerd’s face.
You even accepting that battle proved you're a rapper with the worst traits.
You view this as a white league. You wanted to feel blacker in the worst way,
You shoulda known it would be a Dizaster in the first place,
'cause that’s a spit in Eurgh’s face.
And in the States, you'd be an average, colo(u)red battler. That's all, that's it.
You got a little humo(u)r, some flavo(u)r, but I don't think you all that sick.
Plus the rumo(u)r is you still owe Flex a little money,
and that's who you’re trying to avoid contact with.
There's no hono(u)r in that behavio(u)r.
He paid you for labo(u)r. You decided to fall back quick.
Now this is an angle and a scheme. You probably won’t get it on the first listen,
but I said colo(u)r, humo(u)r, labo(u)r…
Anyway, in the U.S., we spell certain words different. The point is this:
Against Brits, that’s the battles that gave you clout.
But think about those words, Tony. All it takes is an American to take you(U) out.
What made you doubt I would win? This a L he’s getting.
I see death in your future; I can’t help these visions.
Long rod ‘ll make sure it’s his self he’s sticking(selfie stick);
you get the picture? My shit is sicker, and that's why you losing now,
against Mr. Jump-to-top-tier-from-the-Proving-Grounds,
Bosstown.
TONY D
So you’re from Bosstown. I was gonna do a Boston rapper scheme, Bro.
Then I realized, there’s Guru, Solar’s ex-boyfriend..
and the guy that was in Gangstarr with Premo. And Benzino.
You can tell how I step that I’m on classics.
It’s an explosive level in the building like bomb damage.
The diss pen’s fire, ‘cause this pen fire, it dispense fire,
cue(Q) flames like a Bond gadget.
I’m cookin and these bars will char-grill your arse, Chill.
It’s a flipping body, hands down, it’s all in the air like a cartwheel.
I just finished washing the blood off from my last kill,
now I brought the big guns out about to rock it for money like an arms deal.
There's skulduggery a(-)foot if I’m on my job.
They put the king vers’ I.
Well to get a(-)head, that’s your neck on the chopping block.
Theres no bones to pick with Tony’s shit. This simple precision.
You try muscling on god’s turf, well, thats a sin you(sinew) committing,
and I’m too blessed. That’s why he don’t know what to do next,
'cause his brain can't stomach the idea I ain't food yet.
We rematch, I’ll be the last man standing over two legs.
So he losing hard, and thats just bar for bar. That’s barring performance.
Chill(-)a body on ice. You’d swear I come to harvest some organs.
Now if you got that, and you caught the unifying theme in it properly,
It was like, blood.. You know what, fuck it, watch it back.
That’s how you scheme on a body.
Now if i seem to be cocky, it’s 'cause I’m properly focused.
You're getting polished off, dusted down,
swept up, I’m cleaning house, just show I can keep up with the Joneses.
Im mercenary molded. I use foresight(Forsythe) in the planning stage.
This The Day of the Jackal, and I’ve got the gall(de Gaulle) to assassinate.
I woke up just to kill like a Manchurian candidate.
So you came to the UK for whose name? Are you sane?
You must be close to nuts, 'cause i got you in the pocket. That’s loose change.
Your number’s up, bingo, and we're in front of a full house.
To see me put another kid in a box, like when its too good to pull out.
See I can read his thoughts, so I’ve got to let the people know,
he can't beat me fair and square; he swear he should’ve cheated like Keyshia Cole.
They love you in Canada, over here different treatment though
'cause whats usually Organic(k) process(ed) getting sprayed. That’s a G.M.O.
So I figured, 'cause you don’t really rap that well, I’ll stick to the plan
and (w)rap circles ‘round you til you tire like the Michelin Man.
Now this my hometown, so don’t get annoyed if you can't win,
and start hyping up, ‘cause I’m poised to just spark him
like I’m boycotting stardom.
‘Cause if I flip, then it’s Clips and Loaded, or Loaded and Clips,
‘cause I’ve got to see money hit the floor like a coin toss in Harlem.
Don't you know to take your shoes off when you come into somebody house?
“This K.O...T.D, you get knocked out, just for touching down.
My Arsenal: Caustic...his D.N.A. in Dirt bags under ground,”
Lu, you say some shit like that, if Urkel ain't leaving, it's Hurricane season,
I’m throwing you(U) in the fucking crowd. Fuck all of that dumbing down.
Who want what? One-two box cut leave Lou mopped up.
I been Kobe when the shot come;
in the shark tank, big fish. The home team in the aqua.
Rush in(Russian) and he smearin’ off(Smirnoff), little homie, it don't mean vodka;
fucking punch take Lu back like Chernobly in the hot tub.
Quit playing the killer, Lu.... you not one.
This Lu person keep it a hundred; that's higher than Lou percent.
You died before you got here, Lu; I hired the looper sent.
Talk money, it's not funny when Lu purse end.
From here on out, I'm charging Lu per cent.
Now that’s some effortless skill; he ain’t gon check me for real
the exodus will, eventually feel
like you were fucked before the credit came; this Netflix and chill.
You less than a meal.
Rap game Charlemagne, Guard ya chain.
This for every gift that Lou didn't send on Father's Day.
Look at him. He’s got my eyes. Even though you got your mama name.
Trees riding the Bentley like Scarlett Payne on Arbor Day,
then drop all of his diamonds in the road like the carpool lane.
All types of ill shit, when I pass a fire over his head
to bring an end to a couple points like Marlon Wayans.
Do.. we.. have.. a.. problem, Lu? That's all I'm saying.
Hey, shit, that's just the build up. I been trying to get the bills done.
Pick the ice up singing La Bamba, that's a Lou diamond fill up.
I'll kill him.
You cheesy. "Lu easy, and a purchase (Louisiana Purchase)
bring misery(Missouri), I owe a (Iowa)
couple ass kicks, his cans is (Kansas)
in a state he don't know da code of. (North Dakota)
And he prolly doesn't know but
the Louisiana Purchase bought Missouri, Iowa, Kansas and Dakotas,
some of ya'll thinking real slow, huh?"
No, bruh. You just been in a drag race spinnin donuts.
His lines? From different battles.
Ciph a biter, don't provide a forbidden apple and start lickin samples.
Lu, you got a "Bowflex" line? Maybe a "no flex" line?
Well then I get to slap you. What?
I'll pull your lip above your eyebrow hair.
Looking like you did a 3 year bid in the time out chair.
I'll throw Ciph downstairs.
If you scheming, it's a pyramid.
I axe you to leave, I got an actual axe and I'm actually serious.
It'd be a shocker if you had a career to fix;
one jab and his ear get clipped,
he'll have a hard time moving forward without a Walker,
he ain't Fast, but he’s Furious. Y’all hearing this?
Hey, they say, "Lou's a beast. Lou's on fire. Lou's a match for you."
Lou's a little bitch. You gon lose the fucking battle and the attitude.
Next phase, the temptation stage, boy I can snap on you.
Lu, you cannot lose all the respect I didn't have for you.
And Lou means toilet in England. Time.
First thing I thought of when I heard I was battling Madflex
is, "I'm on King of the Dot, fuck Madflex. Madflex is a faggot."
Multi syllable rapping is an irrelevant tactic, but, I'm better at that shit.
But why fight fire with fire when I ain't here for wrestling matches?
And that's some of my lighter shit.
Once they booked this, he already knew he was outmatched.
‘Cause he watched my C3 battle, seen me give C3 K's
and thought he seen 3K from Outkast.
He watched the Tru Logik battle,
and with this gift, it makes sense he'd be out (w)rapped.
After viewing me versus Tru and C(truancy),
he already knew he'd be outclassed.
So y'all think Flex is dope?
Well, he on the ground floor of ground zeroes and I'm next to blow,
so y'all should already know
that I'm on a higher level by the time I get to my second flow(flo’).
I think Flex is bull. I can't even touch my effing toes,
These stretches killing me,
so it makes sense I can't reach for defeat, I ain't got Flex ability.
Da feet bars. I know that's some shit y'all ain't impressed with
but for me, y'all gon have to make exceptions.
I’m nice. This year, I've gone from rapping with my friends using flash cards
to flashing up on cards at the biggest battling events.
In my Troy battle, I used a Palamalu bar that established many trends
in 2015, but what's crazy here is I coulda covered Mad in(Madden) 2010.
Video game bars. You see, that shit happens naturally
when you battle rapping me.
I've already finished him, but I'm still beasting. That's a animality.
Everything coming out of Mad is actually average rap to me, so average actually,
that we nicknamed your studio the saddest factory(satisfactory).
Wordplay. That’s the reason I'm on this card in the first place.
It's the reason Eurgh gave me Shox the Rebel on Don't Flops's seventh birthday,
and the shit I got after Shox(aftershocks),
it ain't even natural, Dizaster, but it's gon make the earth quake.
I swear to God I'm first rate.
I’m one of the best to do it, but don't expect the rest to quote it,
'cause while I was busy catching wreck before, they slept for most it,
but the vets'll notice.
So while I'm spitting, zoom the camera in on Arsonal face and let it focus
and you'll see that Lu Cipher verses shock the Rebel like my next opponent.
Flex is hopeless.
Come on, I don't care what you want now, It's time to move on down.
Every stanza sicker than cancer, and I got two more(tumor) rounds.

It's like that, Lu? After I accepted your friend request on Facebook,
you a soldier? Now you heartless? One shoulder check, his arm split.
Storm brought you hoping that you both would get adopted.
Hue and Riley Freeman flew from Florida in darkness,
‘cause they both could ride for free inside the overhead compartment.
What you want, street violence? Sweet science?
Project Greek Island won't even hide him,
so don't push any buttons, we speed dialing.
You see him go like this? (wave and point) Means there's prolly police sirens.
I'll take a couple out like peace signing;
get stuck deep in the back of his head, I'm tryin to remind him.
Left attack-- Cheshire cat: a bitch trip and see nothing but teeth flying.
Man, fuck him. Uppercut him til he float through the air
with arms flapping staring at the bird like Koko B. Ware.
Shit, I'm rolling up like mobile repair,
then put him in the trunk so long, this motherfucker will propose to the spare.
You got me fucked up. All this yappin’, talking.
If I stand to box him, half Colossus with the option to brand with losses.
land a cross and spook so many bosses, I'm thinking my hands are haunted.
Baby J, you a bad accomplice. you just let his album drop and,
didn't say a word when the man done called it Swaggaholic?
Like, you just gonna stand and watch it? “Yeah, that's solid!"
Look, man. I did research for you, Lu! I had to knock it
just to have the thought that I'd be better off puttin my ear up to a bag of dogshit. Mad been plotting. Drag a square, you get the picture? Canvas croppin.
White boy with the punches of Dan and Caustic
but style somewhere compared the heir apparent to Pass and Locksmith.
I got this bag, it's a plan to shoplift;
fuck Lu Cipher. You don't exist if this Miyagi don't pass the chopsticks.
Wipe that look off your face or I’ll slap it off, bitch.
Your cohorts fall short short as the short shorts on Magic Johnson.
Lu was like, “Battle of the night is a cash deposit.”
Homie, what the fuck make you think I don't take your half the profits?
Pourin out the fluid the man’s embalmed in,
show up to your gravesite to
talk to Lu like pop a “Woo”(Papa Wu): Action Bronson. Laugh it off then.
Run up in your backpack, Cipher.
4 dudes, the same beating, that's a backpack cypher
Start recording the corpse on the floor and snapchat MyVerse,
texting people at your funeral like “hashtag lightwork”.
I'll see you in the third if you ain't died first.

Unseasoned fans, y’all make writing for a nigga like me wack as shit,
'cause y'all can't put two and two together;
Y’all look at basic math like its calculus.
So when I say I'm a Prodigy wreaking Havoc,
I mean, y’all don't know nothing ‘bout the shit,
so what's the point in finishing the scheme about how he look like Alchemist
when I already know what the outcome is?
I'm better at rapping, but sometimes I find it's best to be average,
so I took the chemistry joke outta my round
'cause I knew it wouldn't get a reaction.
That was a bar too. You just gotta read between the fine print,
instead of getting out of line every time that I rhyme shit.
But I get it, it’s hard to stay in your lane if you ain't got what a line meant,
so I’ma give y'all something a little easier to digest.
Hi, Flex. Didn't you say you was smoking me tonight? Are you high, Flex?
Whoever said they see this battle going either way has gotta be bi, Flex,
'cause I'll bend your body in two different places and tell you bye Flex(biflex).
Still thinking you can outmuscle me, I’m thinking, “why, Flex?”
You ain't got enough biceps and triceps to try Flex.
I'm bout to try Flex. Die, Flex.
For this guy Flex, I show no type of respect. I'm from the school of Reflect,
So whatever he taught to me, I got to reflect.
You gonna throw shots? Well, they gon bounce off of me, Flex.
I got way too much D, Flex(deflects),
but this hammer? It ain't for your knee, Flex, I ain't tryna check ya reflex.
What, y’all tired of these Flex bars?
It’s cool, I got Mad Magazines for Mad Men. Y’all gon be making a mad dash;
if Mad flex, I'ma hit Madflex with mad Macs(Mad Max).
You mad trash. Glad bags the only place for Mad tracks.
Original controller in this game. I ain't playing with these Mad Catz.
Telling you, y’all gon get exactly what you was asking for.
If you had your money on Mad, I bet you mad now if you wasn't mad before,
‘cause I can take the bull, and grab the horns.
When opportunity knocking, man, of course
I'ma open him up, 'cause Mad a door(matador).
I'm from where the glocks dumping on the block,
and you dumb if you think that the cops coming,
they not. You not from it , it’s obvious; stop fronting.
Good night. You had a good fight but your box coming.
Hood type: the same type of Thug Life that Pac stomached.
And every time I step inside the booth I weaponize the truth
Cop a shirt; they fifteen a pop, twenty-five for two.

Some of y’all thought I was play pimping. Nay, bitches, I'm all heart.
Lu got the swagger of Paul Blart,
and Flex out here shitting on a tall card with all bars.
Do me a favor. Tell Marvin when the mission to mars starts
cause my patience running just a little thinner than his arms are.
Looking like Arsenio Hallmark.
Little man, I take the Crown with me like I lifted a squad car.
You the width of a pop tart.
A battle? This a victory lap through a Memorial: I'm Lynch in the golf cart,
Young Wal-Mart! I hear that eating clocks is time consuming,
I get it. But what the fuck a sheep gon do with a lion moving?
Come get it. These tards been theme park cause they ride with you, but
I get your back, I’ll get your back leaking out spinal fluid.
Flex designing proof you a stepping stone like the Mayan Ruins.
Silent movements send you skyward cruising;
I will lift you up so high, you can see whatever sign the moon’s in
and cop a squat on the the spot on the flyer that Diz and Gjonaj are using.
Lucifer headline in the afterlife, and Mad provide the height improvement.
My influence?  E-40, Biggie, L and Ice Cube.
Lu rap really well… but like really well for a white dude,
it’s, like, different, know what I’m saying?
Organik, I don't care how many weirdos you call.
They keep saying the same shit when I take one down
like ninety nine bottles of beer on the wall.
For real. You don't know the drill: a Step Brother bunkbed.
Been around crime like caution tape and Bloodshed.
Now Me/Cipher: Street Fighter, cease fire, and I'm Balrog in the subtext,
‘cause even when I kick it, shit just turns into a slugfest, and this bum next.
Now you rep Waystid Talent, (Lu makes hand sign)
and that's the first time in his life that he's thrown hands in a club yet.
Don't get upset.
For show and tell, I brought this bag. Coco Chanel.
It's beasting vers’ a bee sting, and these things don't go so well,
‘cause Lu is in the loop, but I AM the loop; I hold the belt.
Asshole. Roll and sell any ample cash flow;
the show goes on, when Lu pay(Lupe), it still ends in a Fiasco.
This man is more ComiCon than octagon.
Do not yell or a Molotov cocktail hit the top shelf of ya Dodge Stealth.
Palmin a Corona, lime and fold-up under a palm up in Corona.
They call him Roswell:
his disc dropped and the populous don't know nothing. But no fronting.
Both of us been battling worse shit,
to the point where it don't matter rehearsing.
But the point is that you still don't test Flex vers’ the average person.
Slam and search em. Come back and ask if this trash is worth it,
nah, ‘cause you can't even muster up half of the version of my clash with Urban.
Back with purpose, Still ain't scratched the surface of active service.
This control, I change the whole scene quicker than channel surfing
when I lift his facial skin like a plastic surgeon.
They hand you a magic bullet , you had a shot, the plan was perfect,
Mad just curved it. Pack this nerd’s shit.
I'm taking Lu's career as a souvenir and you right the fuck back to worthless,
and I went first ’cause your third is some shit I ain’t concerned with.
Flex.

There's an infrared beam that sits on the top of every pistol I got,
so I guess in more than one way this a battle with the King of the Dot.
Flex, you wanted your chance to shine with the best?
Well, that's until I give him a shot,
and since this bum got the card bored,
well, now you can live in this box.
You'll be in the dirt, bagged.
DNA ‘ll be everywhere; they'll be calling you Dan,
‘cause sticking him up with a big K ain't a part of the plan.
That goes to any nigga on the card that want to go to war with the craft;
I got a frag grenade to put a tag on Coma toes if he walk in my path.
Reverse Live? Meet reverse lived; I’ll torture ya ass.
You holding guns, but you only got only one; I’ll let an arsenal pass.
Somebody tell Flex he's filler.
Y'all need to put me in the ring with a Ness Lee, Chilla,
so I can really disrespect these killers.
I got enough pent up rage in my pen to slay seven Days,
so bring on the next weak(week) nigga.
Oh, it gets deep. This nigga Lu is in beast mode.
It's like I knew the cheat code to the human genome
So even if I go 75%, QP, even you’d you'd get 3-0’d.
I know it's hard to understand what I'm speaking if you don't have any season,
but 3 O's is 75% of a QP, mathematically speaking.
Yo Lush, I thought I was going to London next month.
So why am I battling a(-)broad?
I ain't Jonny Storm, but I got a deadman added to this card.
They talking in my head.
I’m just trying to listen to the right voices through the white noises.
Before I snap and bring an end to your name with five nines just like Royce’s.
My point is there's no way that you fucking up my voyage.
One look at you and I can tell you ain't comfortable with your life choices,
I mean, look at you. I mean, examine the type of shit that this pussy on;
what kinda nigga got a mohawk,
but you ain’t never seen him without a hat and a hoodie on?
I mean I could be wrong, but does that make any perfect sense?
That's like a nigga with full body tattoos
that you never see without a long sleeve turtleneck.
The weight of the city rocking on my back; that shit is big as a boulder.
With enough rep to carry the body too; tell this bitch I'm a soldier.
I trained for this - you gotta pay for this bit of exposure.
For thinking it's free to lay(Frito-Lay) on my back,
well I got a chip on my shoulder.
Yo, the only reason I really came out here
was to fuck some California bitches,
smoke some good weed, get some good vibes,
and rap about shooting 4k's while Avacado get my good side
You see all this shit right here? You’re welcome.
Consider this a early Christmas present,
‘cause it’s a gift you even (w)rapping in my presence(presents).
You been caption every second, got to at me every mention,
just been asking for attention.
You worried if I’ma bail, B? Well this a jail fee, I’m ‘bout to tax you every sentence.
Now that I’m getting paid here(hair), bitch, I weaved that battle.
And I don’t need this battle to get you Smacked with an extension.
I should’ve docked her pay, but they told me be patient with MyVerse.
Well I don’t got a ghostwriter. The fuck I look like waiting on my verse?
They say you diverse. That’s no Biggie. You Ready to Die, Verse?
‘Cause my verse, even Eminem couldn’t Stan(d). That’s suicide, Verse.
How my verse’ll leave you exposed after it Boom,
you would think I gave Tsu a side verse.
Your shit is filler. What’s in my hand Quentin Miller; don’t make me write, Verse.
Wait, out of all the rappers you know, though, top five dead or alive,
you picked Jadakiss? Well that’s a Why, Verse,
but thinking you out of this world?
Mama stop it, after I give Jo(h)nny Rockets, it’s you and I(U-N-I), Verse.
Slip up, ‘cause when I put a tho(ugh)t in a box, it ain’t a suggestion.
Where does this forty go? Rhetorical. The answer request chins.
I let a couple get at ‘em(Adam) then Eve-n they rib buckle.
One word and the pop gon ground you; this kid trouble.
But if the money official, my ratchet wig on stage: Ms. Hustle.
Six ring back to back for the green; I’m Bill Russell.
I know y’all like, “Leave homes alone.” Like I encountered Fit
to encounter a counterfeit. Man, you niggas got me furious.
You could bet the bank on it that every stock’s in Bon(d),
so why would I take a D verse if I(diversify) took the money serious?
Y’all know I only Kill for the Bills. So if you be a trick’s kid, oh, I steal daughters.
You wouldn’t have to punch your way out this box; I kill smarter.
A pie may(Pai Mei) show you I’m nothing but a snake;
come dance with a real mamba.
My pimp hand’s sharp; I will scar her.
I cut bitches for talking out the side of their face: Bill’s father.
I ain’t gotta imagine this shit, bitch. You got to imagine a line.
I be rushing to get out of bars. You be rushing to get your bars out;
y’all see how different we be battling time?
Your man’s cap could fly in the crowd over half of a line.
Don’t get your own (Charron) slapped; that won’t have your character Shine.
Just be the hippie Orlando bitch that you are. Don’t rap about shit that you not ‘bout.
‘Cause if you don’t think I’ma bully you,
I’m too big for a mid to school, play tough and get knocked out.
When the nine approaching, it’s get ate up or clocked out.
‘Cause the tool spray like it’s school grades or her boobs may:
A cup ‘ll(couple) drop out.
I already told you I’m on some other shit. I could’ve raised you, bitch.
Groundbreaker to housekeeper the way I made(maid) you, bitch.
If it wasn’t for me, you’d still be battling free, so thank me, bitch.
Nah, don’t even thank me. Fuck you. Pay me, bitch.
What up bitch? You trash, but I’m glad to see you made it,
even though you almost a year late.
I told Mister Wansel this battle won’t Pop unless the deal straight.
She rob and leech(Robin Leach), trying to get her bills paid,
so since you dine and dash, let your head get the steel(steal) plate.
You ain’t a shark in this; I’m trying to kill greats,
and I’d rather drop science instead of math in this chapter,
but the mass have a factor, in this fact of matter.
You’re more known for giving that face than Jaz the Rapper.
I’m Queen of the Ring. Holly or Ali. Someone tell Bonnie I’m rawly.
Catch her all happy and jolly, blasted on mollies,
sneak her(sneaker) then check her like a pair of Huaraches.
She rides shotty with her mommy beside her,
I’ll cock, squeeze, make her knock knees and body the driver,
leave Bonnie Godiva’s body to divers.
Your situation looking Rocky through the Eye of the Tiger.
I’m a big dog. Rottweiler with a collie beside her.
She a average joe: sloppy, slide her(slider).
Ask snobby, I’ll smack the saliva.
Weave bobby pins out your tracks just to show how I style her.
This battle was only a solid, ‘cause this what the fans favor.
It may be on your agenda, but you can’t date her,
‘cause if the wood fill her,
you saw dust(sawdust), those walls crushed like sandpaper.

You tatted a slanted dick between your banana tits. That’s just tacky, B.
She steady juggling sacks with seeds, and I ain’t talking bags of weed.
When she walks, y’all don’t hear galloping? Kentucky Derby running laps, looping?
Just ‘cause you wear horse hair won’t make you a Black Beauty.
Those synthetics have overran their courses.
She yelled to Math, “I’m ‘bout to pull my hair out.” He said, “hold your horses.”
But even without a guy’s help,
with all that weave, you’ll still always be Bonnie and Clydesdale.
Won’t let her roots grow, but in Bon’s eye(bansai) that treatment is the norm.
I could strand my killings on your hair, but that’s beating a dead horse.
‘Cause if it wasn’t for me, bitch, you’d still be battling for free on Smack.
You have a stage today ‘cause I let you speak when I asked.
You thought your stomp would leave me starving? I’m still eating, in fact.
You keep giving us leftover bars, well that’s gon lead me to scrap.
No poetry for a reason to snap.
This work from my hand ‘ll give you a permanent band
since you want to twerk for the cam.
My bloodline bred martyrs. Taught ownership, not to work for the man,
so I became Panama’s legendary puncher: Roberto Duran.
Your family’s Jamaican, right?
So that immigration line for Ms. Fit was a mis-fit. Check your angle then.
‘Cause if we roger that, her American Dad left no name for him,
plus your tranny uncle is the gender-confused alien.
Back in Jamaica, they call a fag “anti man”.
So that batty boy became your auntie, man.
In this game, if it’s any console, we’ll just name it “Aunt-le”,
‘cause we know that’s a chick with a dick,
even if you “Look at the Flick of the Wrist.”
But I got this new dance, it’s called hitting this bitch.
This is the stage that only matters. Why face?
Titles, I snatch, fast as Pai Mei.
You couldn’t try Florida if you had the Tri-State.
I’m putting Godiva in a box; that’s Valentine’s Day.
You said you could freestyle better than me. Well guess what I got tonight.
‘Cause you just said a Pai Mei bar; this is bad business.
‘Cause all y’all do is trade marks that Copy write.
Back to freestyling. I see you brought a legend. He making crazy waves.
Well if I aim the lead, both of y’all be dancing with Crazy Legs.
I can’t help I’m sick. My whole life I never had aides(AIDS) rapping.
I don’t do shit the Eazy way.
I’m from a state where you can die when you land,
get D.O.A.’ed at your E.T.A.
You ever see my niggas courtside on the bench?
That’s courtside at the NBA.
But see your niggas courtside on the bench,
they court siding with the D.E.A.
So why should I believe the bullpen of verse or remember Verse
when she said she tried to bail me out,
but didn’t mail me out a phone call, letter, or even a pen from Verse?
Bitch, I felt like Fifty in that cell all alone. Like why raise her(razor)?
If when I was in the pen’, a verse brought me sane,
so now you getting chalked the same,
‘cause the walls where I’ma pen a verse.
Lord forgive me; I’m ‘bout to re-pen(repent) a verse,

let’s go to church.
It’s a holy ghost,
‘cause I’ll be clapping and stomping soon as they quote a verse.
My method is(methodist) to get your fellow shipped and open, Verse.
Let me work, ‘cause by the third round, Clips vers’ Lux:
first the preaching, then you’ll be piecing together a broken verse.
I don’t rehearse, and yet I’m still acquiring half of they bank,
‘cause the first one’s to fall into sin be the first ones to judge,
like soon as they see a ladder they(Latter-day) saints.
So let’s get to confession,
‘cause you be acting like Jo(h)nny Cash could get you Grammy songs.
Or ‘cause you in the Tribe Called Quest, you Queen Latifah when the cameras on.
Well, men lie and women lie, but the truth is in the camera phone.
Four years ago, you was fucking another battle rapper,
in his t-shirt with no panties on?
You talking all this battle rap shit, but you was fucking Madd Illz?
Bitch, Madd Illz? I’m mad. Ew.
But you remember them Grind Times. You must’ve had a ill disease,
‘cause you gave Ill the V to battle Ill V,
but no matter which ill you be, you ain’t ill as me.
You nothing but a Grind Time groupie that’s limelight choosie;
but why pick a old biter over a big dog? Bitch, this ain’t the Twilight movie.
She like, “So? At least he took me on a tour of the South.”
Bitch, please. You couldn’t even get a tour of his house.
He room and board her, Total Slaughter;
I wonder if he touched her core(Cor’) on that couch.
But I figured you’d let my trey pound now,
since you used to niggas dogging you out.
It that why she don’t want to profess her(Professor) X?
She was just on his team. Bitch why your Jeans gone?
I guess that make him Cyclops:
he seeing fire in a bird, but put another Mystique on.
‘Cause the way she blew(blue) skin off niggas,
she don’t even feel comfortable in complete form.
That’s why she had to switch up characters to see Storm.
You got the whorest of ways. Rihanna falling on stage: this hoe tripping.
It seems you weren’t cut from my cloth; we so(sew) different.
I got drive, Progressive, commercial;
you just ride for insurance. Our flow’s different.
Talking about sheetrock, right? You nothing but dry walls for fun,
guys, the mold different.
I mean, how the fuck did you even get here?
Norbes, you took her to the roof? You ain’t hesitate to jump off, did you?
Another rookie mistake,
thinking you gon hit main stage just ‘cause he let one(-)off in you.
But since you do get a(-)round, it’s only right I let one off in you.
I told you, I could’ve raised you, bitch.
Housebreaker to groundkeeper how I made you, bitch.
If it wasn’t for me, you’d still be battling free, so thank me, bitch.
Nah, don’t thank me. Fuck you. Pay me, bitch.
*Freestyle*
First off, I’m here today ‘cause of blood, sweat, and tiers; I earned it.
But I know about three rappers that fucked you and can confirm it.
So your little premeditated bars, that shit’s not working.
How the fuck you freestyling so good,
but in Milwaukee you kept pausing? You should’ve been saying Jersey.
*End freestyle*
But wait, ladies and gentleman. Sexual Chocolate. Sexual Chocolate.
We need a axe now, really, to start chopping this fable.
You said your last match on URL was on the spot,
freestyle, what you brought to the table, right?
You ain’t atomic off the top. That’s a diss missile(dismissal).
I seen the signal when you picked the bitch that looked just like O’fficial.
And your pre-style against QP was ass; you mooned everyone that caught view.
No shade, but it must’ve burned the way that Son blocked you.
As a true emcee, that’s a low blow.
Shit was a knockoff. Say it ain’t so, hoe(SoHo).
Y’all just getting those “ether bars” from that other card she no-showed.
You couldn’t even sway Sway. You cut off 40 like you was gon spit that flame,
but was so out the pocket, they gave her change.
Sway had to explain, “it’s okay.”
They stopped the track. “She battle raps, this wasn’t your lane.”
Babs got you on Shade 45 to spit it live. Probably her biggest regret of all.
Bonnie bombed that cypher so bad, y’all would’ve thought Flex was on.
Lying(lion), trying to run, but you gon live with this Scar.
DJs wouldn’t slip your disc if you got hit with their car.
Plus, you say you draw, but that’s all sketchy.
Your definition of sexy is slutty, flat-out, it’s not edgy.
You may live in a stable, but your spot’s shaky;
you not ready. Offer me a stage, I’m making sure to Rocksteady.
I’ll admit, you were on a come-up.
At one point, you thought people were ducking you.
It’s not ‘cause you were good, bitch, just sounds like there’s a duck in you.
Can’t even think for herself. Just a thot trying to claim.
It’s like, no skills, all facade for the fame.
Yeah, it was Gladiator School, but we were not entertained.
You a weakling in this region; I seen it from the bleachers.
So I got in the game to teach ‘em how to beast it.
You lack leadership and genius.
You’re the Cyborg of battle rap: a cheater with a penis.
Remember when QP wrote for you? I know it’s hard to say,
but everything in the dark comes to light, ask Charlemagne.
QP used to haggle her for that wholesale,
‘cause when that hoe sale didn’t charge the same,
she got the Math and had to bargain for bars to gain, what a shame.
I mean, holy ghostwriters, but hey, there’s always Born again.
Let me take you to church. Born getting washed for his sins.
It was what the four told (foretold) to smite the gins
Cause I'm here speaking my verse but your lips reciting him(hymn).
Have you looking at her shake, like your last gimmick.
I’m catching this body tight, but she need her ass lifted,
especially when them butt pads missing.
I bet 40 ain’t seen you write one rap lyric. Bold face.
You wear shit with no circulation, thinking it’s gravy with all that flabby meat.
Y’all bugging if you think Bon that petite(bon appetit).
I’m here for the scolding.
You trying to rap about doing a rap, ‘cause you got your tat in holding,
but got out real quick. What’s the reason?
Felt lonely behind bars, I guess it was cuffing season.
I’m saying a game of spades is the only time you ever had a bid.
It’s like a jail riot they way they gas your pen.
You gon say I’m Latina, need a Visa, but you’re the one scamming them.
Oh yeah, and your wig fucked up. Thought I’d leave that hair relaxing? Ew.
I bet the back of your neck is scabbing. Bitch need to switch your perm.
She went from Math to multiple partners;
the prime number of STD sums, one thing’s for sure:
say goodbye to your dick. Buy that shit a urn,
‘cause Bon? Bon(bong) go smoke your bud’s pipe, watch her switch a(swisher) burn.
My presence(presents) has them playing swear to god:
guess that’s a gift and a curse.
You trying to sell them on fake dirt like that’s a pitch that’ll work.
But you couldn’t finish a sixteen, so how the fuck you gon finish a Verse?
You keep talking about that shit in Milwaukee,
but it was ten people in that room. So in other words, they all vic.
Far as bars, check my rap sheet. Crime pays, and you know it’s easy to con vics.
So what, you want to talk about Born?
I told you, this battle I’m having a open verse,
but keep talking about Born and my last battle,
I might have flashbacks and start choking Verse.
I ain’t even want this to be you, though.
Since I found out you like battle rappers, I was kinda hoping you’d like me.
And whoever told you white men can’t jump never met Mike P.
I mean, I know you like to spit. I could give you the Mike(mic) free.
But wait, maybe I should Do the Right Thing,
so let me finish icing this Spanish bitch on cam like Spike Lee.
She really think she the most def poet,’cause she be taking Q tips,
and spitting knowledge for the crowd reaction.
Well say one thing to me about The Roots,
and you won’t even be conscious rapping.

I get the melanin to push her melon in;
when I black, history. You don’t got the memories.
You just salty you ain’t hot this season.
Well call cajun(caucasian) if you ain’t got the recipe.
‘Cause your Net flicks(x) shows you need to stay in class,
all that Breaking Bad, you just ain’t got the chemistry.
Fuck a knife or a weapon; my mind is inception. I break towers mentally,
so while you new-slaving, I’m deuce-deuce waving,
and I don’t want to hear shit about the Zulu Nation.
Or bitch, see, Toots, see, you could be the next one who two facing.
Wait, she ain’t even get that.
Let me show you how a con go(Congo) harder.
I said Zulu, Tootsie, Hutu… that mean when I slap every tribe out her,
even Afrika Bambaataa ‘ll rewind her(Rwanda) slaughter.
Murk me? How, bitch? You ain’t even worth the while.
I’ll smack this bitch on the bathroom floor; now she Verse-a-tile.
‘Cause I’m mad y’all even think Verse is better,
‘cause she circle-stepping, blurting metas and nervous gestures,
desperate for a card again(cardigan)
so all these nerds could sweat her(sweater),
so now, I got to Prep for Redemption.
‘Cause if these bars don’t Chill(-)a nigga, I got the perfect setup.
When it’s showtime, you either getting Clips or Hollows.
I’m trying to figure out which Verbs are better.
The fact you think you
naturally have to rap like Dizaster’s a fucking disease.
She like, “he got baaas.” That’s ‘cause he be fucking the sheep.
I can tell by your ex(X)-men that you don’t want to fuck with a Beast.
So one red flag, I’m at her door(matador) for trying to run with that bull.
I don’t duck bitches. I muzzle they beaks.
This jackrabbit rhymes like a crack habit smack addict;
she really want to be a heroine.
She yelling “fuck the presidents,” but really fuck the presidents;
you bitches love to be in Maryland(Marilyn).
This beatboxing, breakdance hip—
bitch, you don’t even want to be your heritage.
Trying to make a better life thus far by getting stripes off stars?
Aw, you really want to be American.
Well where they discover you land is where this could get settled then.
‘Cause one April shower and I May flower the land you settle in.
But if the Nina Pint-her, she’ll pray to Santa Maria; let that settle in.
That mean you getting scalped in the end(Indian),
‘cause what I peel grim(pilgrim), that’s what a settle meant(settlement).

*Freestyle*
Yo, that’s so funny, you brought your Mike boo, right?
I don’t care what your lines do.
It’s funny, ‘cause ironic you always have a ghost behind you.
(Earlier. You had to be here.)
*End freestyle*
Since you said you top five off of looks alone,
bet I’ll give your top five off of looks alone.
Bonnie ‘ll top five off of looks alone.
You could tell your twat wide off of looks alone.
She figured, Drake loves strippers, so she became one by delusion,
and hopes he move in
and touch her arm and say, “you don’t have to do this.”
You have the nerve to judge Germ Free when you’re worse, B.
You show your bare ass, just for a name.
You’ve literally put everything but your vag on display.
You’re one selfie away from catching AIDS.
She’s in danger, it’s safe to say,
‘cause I could put the four-five to your shoulder,
but if a thirty-eight bust, see your waist in thirty-six days.
Eight teens got hip to the stench of Bonnie rotting(Rotten).
I’ll let the five and nine find you head to toe altered with no options.
Whole time in mind I measured your body for the coffin.
I may not speak it, but I was taught how to aim one.
To tell you the truth, I’d rather make your face up.
Show your jaw the bottom of a barrel; remind you where you came from.
But where you going is beneath and below the floor bed;
you were jerking off in Milwaukee with Vixen.
Really choking; this chicken got bodied by Norbes ex.
‘Cause when you did that, you stepped in some shit, puto.
Want to talk about people choking people, but you though,
in that battle with Uno.
Let me punt(pun) it correct:
if he kicked it last, you would’ve been rebuttal’d to death.
Crazy ‘cause after the battle she gave him dome for the win;
I guess that’s the second time Uno got pussy after choking a bitch.
As a personal vengeance and as a woman, too, I was rooting for you.
We were all rooting for you.
But instead of thinking the whole time, “Damn, what Bonnie on,”
I was thinking, “Damn, Bon, neon?”
My fashion statements welcomed. Your fashion states men will cum,
‘cause if it’s fake angles only, well that’s a lack of creativity shown,
but it’s evident, Bonnie. You’re a hoe.
I got that Erykah Badu pussy; you got that airing out a room pussy.
May be a eye candy, thinking it’s the sweetest,
but like mama said on Halloween, if this (w)rapper’s open, don’t eat it.
You’re a ventriloquist and your clitoris is the color of licorice,
and if you licked her ish then you licked her itch and that’s sick as shit.
So I’ll address her call.
I’m from East Orlando, but I could show you the West Palm.
Goons run up with you saying your name; word is, bond.
Word is, Bon used to fuck John John Da Don,
almost had a baby named Bon Bon Da Don.
This angle for you is signature; she forged her vows. Her initial man opt,
she was just a chicken scratch once she got John hand cock(Hancock).
Here is where the chain connects, where she flaked the best:
you ducked me in April ‘cause you fucked half of the main event.
You vexed, huh?
How ‘bout after Math made you a step-ma he told you to step, Ma,
had a baby with the next broad,
couldn’t take you up, even said you were a lazy fuck.
See how that real ‘ll stretch her?
Or how you had to take twenty blowjobs to support Bill Collector?
I can’t even point out with all fingers who’s your damn lover.
Just habits from her elders she learned to act under.
Your real pops is your dad’s brother,
and you share fucking club clothes with your grandmother.
I was a fan of her, ’til she was stamped an impostor quick.
I’m battling her ghosts ‘cause her writers can’t top my shit.
I summon those skeletons in your closet hid,
‘cause even though I Used To Love H.E.R.,
the resurrection of her was Common Sense.
Shh, quiet down, y’all hear that? I can hear his heart beating.
B-boom, b-b-ba-boom, boom. The champ is here. (x 4)
And Magic? You’re not as lyrical, so please.
You’re fuckin round with a threat, that’s a venereal disease.
Jeez. I should be crowned the best.
They say “keep it rap”; I’ll rap. And wrap both hands ‘round his neck.
You look like you got a venereal disease fuckin round with threats.
I should Smack DVD (the V.D.) out like URL wasn’t founded yet.
Nigga this is ‘bout respect. So please address the crowd and flex,
and get killed after getting out of pocket like Malcolm X.
Get your hands out my p— nigga you heard what I said.
You must’ve slipped, fell, and bumped your motherfucking head.
He dead. Instead I’ll put two in your noggin,
exposing Black Thought, that’s how I get to the Root of the problem.
You request love (?uestlove)? Off of what? Your bars not hard enough.
I’ll have him missing in the Mil(meal) like the drive-thru fucked my order up.
He often punch. But a Danja haymaker maker make a Kamehameha quake.
Face to face, state the date. October Zone (October’s Own); you ain’t facing Drake.
Soon as Black drop the first hit, they gon boo ‘im (boom) like an 808.
It’s safe to say I been god lately.
And I don’t like you, B(QB). Don lady. But I’ll still air it out like Tom Brady.
And don’t use Born to try play me, ‘cause that battle with Born old,
and that B ain’t for Benjamin, but in (Button) here, you gon die, baby.
Crazy. ‘Cause a nigga claiming he not crazy, on a mission, more than gifted,
Incredible with the Hawk, I (Hawkeye)
never seen Black with those (Widow), nor a ‘venger.
With Iron? Man, low key (Loki) he wouldn’t lift a hammer with Thor’s assistance.
I slaughter niggas, and you nothing like Carter. Write harder.
Thinking Danja wack, I’ll bring the fade to Black like Wesley Snipes barber.
I’m your father, ‘cause to D(custody), hearing Magic why I smile in court.
The way I write, BM,
the pen dent(dependent) on the paper and I don’t need y’all(child) support.
With seven days prep, he dying horribly in the sport.
Got out the pen a week ago for what I do today: that’s a Minority Report.
Nigga, and everything I wrote is dope. I’ll rope-a-dope, then comatose ya,
The can, it’a(Canada) shoot to where the pack(Pat) stay like Nova Scotia.
Used to shit and straight flush nobodies til they fold in poker.
On cards for John Dough, it be common names on them like Coca-Colas.
Get capped for the crown; I’ll be done broke his molars.
I made a nigga throw in the towel, you ain’t mafia like cosa nostra.
Poser. I be knocking them off.
Trying to test the waters, you done hopped in with Jaws.
Nigga my style hostile and hotter than yours.
Last nigga laid down the towel(tile); you ‘bout to be remodeling floors.
Danja Zone, is it? Well you about to step in that.
I put a new flame to your Breezy like Gimme That.
What’s in it will(wheel) come out of the can like Fix-a-Flat.
Bumping Wu-Tang; she met the Cal before RZA rapped.
Fix your face. Coming through my hood, better fix your hat.
You must be kidding(kitten), nigga you pussy and I’ma kill a cat,
I’ll pull out a small handgun, that’ll peel his cap,
but that bitch sound BIGger than Guerilla Black, it’s a wrap.
Nigga that Slick talking won’t make you Bond.
You stuck behind bars; question is, can you take the time?
I’ll spray the nine, put this lame in his spine,
think of Michelle Pfeiffer ‘cause this bitch Danger is mines(Dangerous Minds).
Danja gay ass a fan. He Dylan if Writers Bloque was Making The Band.
I’ll scream what I mean ‘bout something stay in the can.
What, you ain’t catch it? You know: Oscar stay in the can.
Let’s turn it up. Don’t think that you’re driving down easy street.
Sneaker-creep. Catch him at work, proceed to beat the geek.
This weak emcee get drug over the counter like CVC.
Jerry coming with something sicker than Eazy E.
What, you ain’t catch it? Jerry Heller, Eazy E?
You know the block is hot, you ain’t gotta hear it from Weezy, we see it’s beef.
And this nigga Danja gon see the heat;
I’m ahead of you, god, I’ll send yo ass to Jesus, peace(piece).
Aight Dane, change of plans.
Hook shot, then get to booting wherever Danja lands.
Talk; don’t raise your hand. Eleven milli on the killings,
and you Vince Carter: you only been on your Grizzly for a minute.
Listen. You gon die today. Boy that Cal’ll wave.
I’ll take your dime and cut her(diamond cutter), I’m Dallas Page.
That bitch’ll be on the Shaft like Isaac Hayes.
Think of Ghost Rider from the fire brain.
Your talk as cheap as your outfit. I’m ‘bout this.
All you can do is piss me off ‘cause you ain’t ‘bout shit.
Who vouch this? When I’m airing the pistol,
just hope your own head make it back to Maryland with you.
Shit, y’all ready for the second round? ‘Cause the first ‘bout killed him.
Then he came with that shit? Apologize. See ‘cause now you done hurt my feelings.
Now after this, hope it’s no love lost,
‘cause see, this might get me cut from my circle. It’s like a buzzsaw.
But you know the name, homie,
it’s Danja Zone ‘gainst James Toney, let’s take the gloves off.
Now when Magic get in a fight, he be like, “give me what you got, son,”
then turned Denzel in Training Day, should’ve seen what he gotten one,
not ‘cause he got wet like Ethan, how the cop done,
but J.Fox was like, “get me the bitch”; Magic was reaching for the Shotgun.
But I want to ask you something though.
Why he ain’t help you? Ain’t you two cripping?
Why you ain’t light up J.Fox like an Amazing Spider-Man 2 villain?
But you ain’t Bad. Beat It. Putting hands on a kid may be in your plans,
but why you ain’t Michael J. Fox? Oh I get it, ‘cause you too shaky with the hands.
But you got One More Chance. To retreat. Which really seems useless.
I’ll make a nigga look Ashanti over a Biggie beat foolish.
You full of false hope. This is pure dope.
To be Frank, I blew(Blue) Magic out; I’m really Team Lucas.
We share your bitch; I’m thinking he’s stupid.
Treat her *as if* she’s best friends with the D(Dee), but he’s Clueless.
Her mouth get all cock; her jaws lock. Tell your whore get some help.
The key to unlocking it is to turn on a knock; she might open some doors for herself.
You do this more for the wealth, but it’s minuscule; get ridiculed.
Dog food, that’s Beneful, you been a fool. Look at what I did to June.
I’m cold, but you know what you should’ve invested in instead of him?
Rent Em Spoons! Rent Em Spoons!
But we gon rob him. After though, John, I read my fine print.
For all that battle money, then we better not find shit.
Ask him, “where it at,” but remain calm and
wave arms if you talk slow, Magic, like a jedi mind trick.
You in a war with a warrior, nigga; can you dig it?
This is my house; you’re just lucky I let you visit.
Was death your mission? To get what you’re searching for,
see me first: I’m more of a YouTube ad that won’t let you skip it.
Could’ve battled anywhere: on the block, your cartel, wherever.
Could’ve got schooled in the IV league; I ain’t no Yale professor.
Concealed with silencers; won’t see or hear, them shots go Helen Keller.
Catch a shell over the chicken; that’s a KFC and Taco Bell together.
(And you just lost the second, nigga. Off with his fuckin head.)
You super-lyrical ass rapper, you need to quit today.
Cut him short; I struck this nigga out when I pitched a K.
It’s okay, lift and, hey, Duck Hunt: pistol play.
It’s whatever. Put these two fours together, we’ll get him ate(eight).
Nah, give him one four, G(4G); that’ll take half of Zone.
Spread the word, I’m going Gettysburg when I battle Zone.
I shatter bones, with black or chrome, leave no breathing.
See, I’ma ask you man to man, where is Zone defense?
I’m sick with it; your men and them get the Thunder.
Revolver spinning, what’s in it I’m sending into your stomach.
Adrenaline get to pumping, the Smith-and ‘ll get to dumping.
Toys ‘ll get to talking like Indian In the Cupboard.
Take notes: why you wack, I’ma give them reasons,
‘cause when you rap, all we see is Slim Jesus.
And that’s your big weakness when you rhyme, Homes.
Throw him in the Eastern Pacific; you got the time, Zone?
Zone time to go ’n die. You even sigh wrong,
I’ll pull out what I’m speaking on like a iPhone.
I’ll pull what I’m speaking on; think of Jadakiss,
‘cause everything you spitting is in question, like the Why song.
Go ‘head with the sneaking,
don’t make me go with the .44; if you give me a reason,
I’ll take the clip out the .22, man, your head’ll be leaking.
I won’t stop with the Emmett til(Till) you dead from a beating.
This nigga sweeter than a milk dud;
fuck him. I’ll put holes(hoes) in him like a strip club.
You big scrub. You seen what I did to Lynx, cuz?
This rapper dead, nigga, R.I.P. to Chinx Drugz.
I’m so deadly; I’m cocking the chrome Desi,
then go nuts on the side of your face like Loe Pesci.
What. I’m so deadly. I’m headed to see you.
I’m walking dead up on a nigga, bitch, my Resident Evil.
Your talk as cheap as your outfit. I’m ‘bout this.
All you can do is piss me off ‘cause you ain’t ‘bout shit.
Who vouch this? When I’m airing the pistol,
just hope your own head make it back to Maryland with you.
This is what advancing up a tier look like.
Keep looking, ‘cause this is also how Battler of the Year look, right?
Right. This a nigga ‘gainst enigma. I’ll murder, slay, slump him.
My win(d)s up. Death, I’ll give this cat a gory one(category 1) like a hurricane coming.
Fuck him. We’ll storm in like really bad weather,
with niggas that’d split your shit off the strength of a simple hand gesture.
With semis and hecklers, on the outside waiting to nail son like Winnie Mandela.
When mill’s(windmills) make him glide, that’s Wilkins and Drexler.
Ricochet when it spray off you with the tan sweater,
then you, then the kid off the wall like he Willie Manchester.
You good; I’m just a tad better. Seek Jesus help.
Lucky Ill ain’t keep clean and good health or else you’d be on the shelf.
From the weigh-in, there’s no way in hell this crip(crypt-) keeping the belt.
What could you tell me for this L, B? What’s on that skeleton that speaks for itself?
Give him heat til he melt. Grab the nine and pop niggas.
First Day, then Danny, now you? I’m even sending shots at my niggas.
That was fuego. Despite who I may know,
I let that milli rock on any block(Bloque) nigga.
Speaking of Bloque niggas? We may be friends,
but they gon speak on this battle with Jerry Douglas, and Danja then
say J.D. lost that bitch like Janet left Jermaine again.
Damn it, I came to win, and he’s still waiting on magician bars.
Magic under the illusion his shit is hard, which is odd.
Pick a card, any card. I got a casket for you,
how you saw the box and(/in) have(/half) the gall with this facade?
Now I gotta disappear and act like fuck it, after I get him gone,
if he pulled a rabbit out his hat it’s still no way he would’ve won(wand).
Buy why lie(voila)?
I’d be got tier if this shit was about classics.
Be real, this shit ain’t ‘bout skill, it’s ‘bout status.
You had Danja, rocking tie without slacking,
and skill got killed by MD like malpractice.
What round did you win?
I’m punching your lights out, you don’t even know the round that you’re in.
But I’m off that. You just a floor mat at The Format,
so before you even mention a nigga, say “Where your bars at?”
This is where you rest in peace;
a motherfucker can die from these bars, and you next to see.
Get your Cake up, bitch, I’ll hit your chest(Chess) with Steams.
Too many counting on your pen; we need a referee.
You ever seen Harlem Nights? Well bet a G
that I won’t fight a nigga quick like Della Reese.
And whoever’s sleeping on me can get the heat;
that’ll wake up everybody like Teddy P.
Tell him we outside, posted up with the heavy glocks.
Cut a nigga throat, then drag him bleeding for seven blocks.
Hit this nigga ten times, but he was gone by the second shot.
I hit him from the blind side like Fetty Wap.
What, you ain’t catch it? Well I ain’t gonna repeat the shit.
Planet of the Apes: this monkey gon get his Caesar hit.
Arms out when I ride past like he need a lift.
You’ll get thirty out the rocket: that’s Kenny Smith.
That’s old school; king Magic come to claim the throne.
Don’t worry walking through this so-called danger zone.
Banging chrome with the fifth on my waist;
this rapper get send to god on a mission with Mase.
All right, stop it with the tough act. Okay Danja, fuck that.
I throw bullets down in(end) Zone ’til it touchback.
How you feel that you’re getting killed with the rough draft?
Slug him, and slug him in the same spot where the slug at.
Hold up. Let me roll up. This pound hold ‘bout forty shots.
Nigga, a freezer won’t the reason this forty pop.
Big strap. This is 50. Hit him from forty blocks,
or get the Thrill of(Thriller) getting knocked down with this 40 Glocc.
Yo, this nigga gon see stars,
getting whipped for a couple of bands like cheap cars.
Next nigga don’t give me my space gon see Mars.
You got a xanny flow: you put niggas to sleep with these bars.
Your flow as cheap as your outfit. I’m ‘bout this.
All you can do is piss me off ‘cause you ain’t ‘bout shit.
Who vouched this? When I’m airing the pistol,
just hope your own head make it back to Maryland with you.
I told ‘em once: these motherfuckers scared,
I’m from the motherfucking Lou, that’s how a motherfucker play it.
Beat me? Can you believe what this motherfucker said?
You must have slipped, fell, and bumped your motherfucking head.
I prepared for a three round battle. Last minute he switched up.
Came dressed like a burglar fiending for money, but he bitched up.
Now you got the crowd down and out.
I mean you’re just gonna go in one big circle, so what’s this one round(-)about?
Ever since Calicoe punked him in the States, he ain’t battled since.
You’ve been a unhappy camper: mad intense(in tents).

www.idjphotography.com
Matter fact, ‘fore I get to this battle rap, let me show y’all what type of cat is Pat.
See? All his big ass'll do is tap you back.
Can I finish my round, or you want to stand up here and go tap for tap?
I mean ‘cause don’t look at the host like nobody‘ll probably stand down,
there’s no Organik. I’m not Charron.
Come to the stage and stop Hollow’s hand (Hollohan) now.
So we already got you punking Charron and Cal punking you.
With that indication, now it’s telling me depending on the pigmentation,
you’ll switch your statements.
With Sketch Menace it’s, “Shut up! Don’t Interrupt me, I’ll kick your face in,”
then it’s, “Hey, Head I.C.E. Your shit’s amazing.”
See I always mention Head Ice ‘cause it’s the Jim Crow law.
They think the darker you are, the harder you are,
or the lighter you are, the lighter you are, and that’s not right.
I give everybody the same respect, but if I have to fight,
I treat a scrap like Mike: I go pop, It Don’t Matter If You’re Black or White.
You’re not a Canada thug. To a street American, you’re a average battling punk
that only gets paid from YouTube, so you add(ad) on the front.
Ooh, I hope you get AIDS and Alzheimer’s,
so you can forget you got AIDS ’til all your exes start dying.
I hope you crash into a median, car flying.
Eighteen wheeler almost hit you but <screech> park by you,
he think he safe, ’til sparks ignited from a small wire,
it explode and he die in a car fire.
Nah, minus the all-timers, I’ll four-five him.
Bigger the body, the bigger the hole size is. We just keep digging like coal miners.
Speaking of coal, I got the coldest flow, cold for sure, four below,
colder than Nova Scotia snow, colder than my heart which is frozen though.
Cold enough to let the toaster go at his grandparents’ mobile home,
Grandma do the rope-a-dope, Grandpa do the okie doke.

Enough of the jokey jokes. They came for your funeral.
It’s a million ways to die, and I want you to choose a few.
When I was young, I was a heat blower: revolvers with speed loaders.
Now it’s a drum and a Tommy gun, look like I’m swinging a leaf blower.
Or, I could’ve got him slaughtered at the border,
by an East African kid that I sponsored for a quarter.
Or, my nigga’s suicidal. He tripping ‘cause he homeless.
I give him the word, he’ll take him with him for a bonus.
Or, my niggas from the seven give him seven for seven pounds.
They bring them guns.
They say “Pat Stay want to play the god? Well tell the King dem come.”
Nah. I said he’s just an informer. So you should Snow what I’ma do with that,
I’m Sizzla mixed with Jigga, Supernat mixed with Super Cat.
I get the vibes(Vybz) from my Kartel, then like Mavado, us two'll Clash.
Then I’m back, moving packs through them bags, stacking Buju bands.
I hold that ting. I load that ting, then reload that ting.
Do this all natural, this my old man ting.
This a cold man ting, this a cold man ting.
Flow so cold, you should snow that ting.
You should snow dat ting, you should snow dat ting.
<Skrrrt> like Reeks when I blow dat ting,
when I blow dat ting, when I blow dat ting.
Pat, didn’t you cross your best friend to amp a crowd for a battle style?
Well you Skip to My Lou, the way you crossed him, then passed him, wow.
Wait, I could add a And-1 ‘cause that was foul;
he Skip to My Lou the way he crossed him,
then went behind his back just to rap a round(wraparound).
Now I got something that I owe Pat. So I’ll give him something old, <pat>.
The steel erase ‘is thoughts(racist thoughts) like the old Pat.
Then I circle around him like a news chopper. With that new choppa.
Big enough to knock down Chewbacca. I’ll Tupac ya then ask Who Shot Ya?
Throw your body over my shoulder: boombox ya.
Steel toe boots on, I’ll moonwalk ya.
Trying to play Jedi mind tricks to Luke ‘walker.
Eminem said you couldn’t sneak a plastic gun through customs,
and he’s right, y’all. So fuck all these gun bars.
Let’s get into these knife bars. I hold it with a steady right,
then get his chest very sliced with a chef Curry knife.
Or a ox pick ‘ll drop his spleen and he’ll need doctor treatment,
got a minute to live, he trying to Google how to stop the bleeding.
Get it down. Rex, keep my name out your mouth and you could get it now.
I’ll spit a round and— ooh, you lucky it ain’t a second round.
Scraight to it, no time to waste. Fuck you, right away.
Fuck you, your gecko eyes and I’m-about-to-start-crying face.
Fuck you, your whiny, Siamese-cat-dying,
Mommy-my-knee’s-scraped, lord-why-me, help-please-untie-me,
I-scream-with-the-dry-heaves-at-a-high-C-five-weeks-straight,
I-need-bass voice, fuck you.
A woman’s fingers jammed in a car door. Other hand in a lawnmower.
Iggy Azalea on tour. Nails on a chalkboard.
A foghorn. Hardcore dog porn.
Just a list of things I like hearing a lot more. Fuck you.
You said in the world I’m number sixty-four?
Then tell them, why the fuck ‘d you pick me for?
What you never thought I’d catch onto it? He set up all of this.
It’s in England, that’s why he picked me over Shotty, it’s obvious.
Battle of the Brave, more like a coward who’s afraid,
respect to Shotty, but I already bodied him,
now you just dug a hole for yourself for me to dump your body in;
body on top of body, I’m on some Giant Gonzalez shit.
Man what you gonna do? Give me some business tips
and educate me like you did with Clips?
Like, “all you have is ClipsTV,” like he got bigger fish.
Dropping all that knowledge, I had to go and look into it.
And dude might actually be onto something, he’s on some different shit.
Innovative genius; he did his research for real.
He got a website now, and t-shirts for sale.
You got hoodies too, bro? Look at you go.

www.idjphotography.com
Whoa. Don’t forget us little guys when you blow.
Dog, you got Loyalty Ova Money custom-made pens?
Shit, they aught to give you a chair on Dragon’s Den.
He’s like, “god, I’m a innovator. Fuck a job or a business major.”
Mum calls him a minute later like, “why is there an intercom in my generator?”
I got to ask you a question, my brother. From one entrepreneur to another,
how did you come up with making shirts in different colors?
Like, just to be a fly on the wall. What next is he gonna discover?
He’ll watch a porn like, “this guy ain’t even a real plumber.”
But wait. Man, what you know about business ethics?
And listen, it’s ‘bout to get interesting.
And I’ll run it back ‘case it gets intercepted and you didn’t catch it.
You gave Drake the Started From the Bottom beat.
Your boy Mike Zombie made it, but you’re the one who shopped it, see,
now, that’s where royalties and publishing occurs.
Stuff just to ensure you get the cut that you deserve.
Mister businessman here ain’t get nothing in return;
his boy Zombie got cha-ching and fuckin chucked him to the curb.
This motherfucking nerve. Talk about my ten grand.
(Oh he’s right here? Yeah?)
He’s right here? Cool, well off the head, man,
he’s just creeping up to you like some type of obsessed fan.
He’s right the fuck there? This dude’s still your friend? Damn.
If that was me, Zombie would be a walking dead man.
Hate it or love it, the underdog’s on top, and this sucka’s getting mopped.
But he was scared to have it judged
so it’s technically just a tie whether he wins or(Windsor) (k)not.
But this is for y’all: for all the TV series they stole, right?
Fuck this American. A Canadian’s stealing the show tonight.
Hollow the Don. What’s your mother’s name, Donna the Mom?
You got a face that says, “I don’t understand how this condom goes on.”
I can’t tell if you look like a salamander or a tropical frog.
Did you catch a flight here or just fucking hop off a log?
Hollow the Don. I’m a big fan of all of your songs.
That’s bullshit. Sound like you’re fucking dropping a bomb.
Hollow the Don. How ‘bout a good old game of follow the palm?
I’ll put a hole in him, leave Hollow all empty ‘cause he ain’t solid at all.
Go to his funeral service; they ask me to turn my volume off,
I’ll fuckin jack that shit up on blast, set the ringtone to Atomic Dog.
No respect. See his casket, I’ll <spit> right on the box.
And that’s the best case, like an Otterbox.
Leave smiling. Cold as February.
Got a strap and I’ll cold buck it(bucket) like Ben ’n Jerry’s.
And I been just dying to bang it like the secretary.
And it stay in my jeans(genes) like it’s hereditary.
I’ll hit the cemetery where your best friend was buried
and steal the red rose from his headstone and replace it with a dead canary.
Disrespect on a whole different level;
rip the stems like a producer sending the engineer an instrumental.
To keep it real with y’all, I could beat Bigg K in just one verse.
So I’ll be on a roll after I tear him to shreds;
I’m fuckin Lush One’s shirt.
They said don’t sleep on your opponent. That fool K legit.
He’s got haymakers and bars; man that dude say some shit.
Y’all hear him in the preview talking greazy?
Like he just gonna soufflé the kid,
man I haven’t heard you that hyped about a trailer
since you got a new place to live.
But his fans talk about him like he the best kept secret,
like it’s blasphemous; he’s somebody that I could never compete with.
He’s top five, next to... Cyborg Eminem and Redneck Jesus;
Bigg K’s such a fucking thug even his name is on some extra G shit.
But honestly bro, I hate how simple you write.
It’s just a bunch of metaphors, similes and likes,
man, motherfucking cats like you get the fuckin idiots hype,
but you an innocent type. We live a different life,
I mean your delivery’s tight, but dog, you are Deliverance white.
I mean, ten years ago, you wasn’t getting down with the bitches.
Looks like you used to paint your face and get down with the sickness.He said he’s got Walmart lines; well that would explained this discounted image.
But you can’t fuck with my brand: this Target ‘ll put Big(g) K out of business.
You are the worst kind of white. That’s why your lines are not good.
This shit’s like South Park: no one understands when Kenny tries to talk hood.
Two years ago, you used to call us all nerds, but I guess he rock with us now,
but if he says a line that don’t get reaction,
then it’s something wrong with the crowd.
You like to talk while people rapping. Oh my god, you’re a clown.
I’ll put a pistol in his mouth. Let’s see him talk through my rounds.

Bitch, I’ll be stalking your house. While you sleeping all alone.
Feel the steel against your dome while you’re reaching for the phone.
He said I got a geek squad. But ain’t no trouble(-)shooting people in your home.
You don’t know my history, dog. I’m incognito with the Chrome.
(He doesn’t even fucking get it, that’s how fucking stupid he is.)
He thinks he’s Nino with the blow, so he deserves what he’s getting.
Shit, you wasn’t locked down for that long, dog, I heard you was snitching.
Oh look at him shaking his head, like you wasn’t a fucking nerd up in prison.
I bet you get checked on sight(site) like terms and conditions.
Dog, people talk like you’re the best, but you are honestly the worst.
Why don’t you go spit some more Digimon bars and then call us all nerds?
So keep this shit rap, and do not talk through my verse,
before I have to make a split decision
about which chin I’m gonna fuckin sock you in first.
Hey yo Caustic. Your nose look like a guitar pick.
Nah, it look like your pops is half swordfish.
My shit rip through bricks and make floor rip,
this a match you ain’t fit for; you should forfeit.
Four-four bulldog or the four-fifth.
Money’ll get a magazine: that’s the Forbes list.
You dead. I’m picking up a box: that’s a forklift.
You softer than Norbes fist; I’m strong as a horse kick.

You rely on personals and disrespect.
‘Cause if you was to just spit, we’ll feel a disconnect.
I rap. You a comedian. Hit your set.
You just a funny, low-life piece of shit, at best.
You gon need Arcane to come and write your verse.
Remember when Soul duffed you? I’ll do you twice as worse.
Rip your throat open; put this knife to work.
The doc’s gon have to button around your neck like life alert.
Big Berettas. The kickbacks ain’t get-togethers.
Twin M-9’s, look like you trying to knit a sweater.
If he bugging, I get to spraying: that’s the citronella.
And one pump can split a pumpkin like Cinderella.
It’s gray hairs in your beard; you should get some gel-a.
You rocking the Salt-N-Pepa like Spinderella.
Bang. While you rip the leaf off a ciga-rella,
you’ll catch a bullet in the teeth like Penn and Teller.
So say my gun bars is fake. Question my thug affiliation.
I went to prison for armed robbery and assault with a firearm;
that’s public information.
But I’m ‘posed to believe he evil and got a gun in the briefcase,
‘cause he scream when he rapping and put on the mean face?
Look man, you walked in a loser. I get the win on arrival.
Jesus Christ, K the god, I go across your shit with a bible.
You gon realize you ain’t fit for survival
once you get the chance to spit with your idol,
and this is a big ass G check like Illmac winning the title.
Now open with a rebuttal. Bring some clown to the vibe.
Dickride the Bay Area to keep the crowd on your side.
But y’all put up a Warhol against a fucking cornball.
You had the whole time I was rapping to think of four bars. Go ahead.
It’s exactly what I expected: bunch of death threats that didn’t mean a thing at all.
I guess the story goes,
if you’ve seen one Bigg K verse, then I guess you’ve seen ‘em all.
I’ll make a deal with all of y’all.
If he can go the next round without saying the word “like”, I will retire from rap.
He thinks he’s Dr. fucking Dre, it’s all “like” this and “like” that.
But you didn’t sound like that in ’09. Shit you didn’t rhyme like that.
Not when you was begging me for battles back in GrindTimeChat.
Shit, I know this guy like that. Me and dude got a history.
I opened doors for this bitch, I guess you could call it chivalry.
I’m trash? Bitch, you trash. You gotta be kidding me.
Whoever dropped you off at the event should’ve got a ticket for littering.
All he talk about is video games and cartoons,
and y’all swear like his bars are the hardest,
but it’s honestly kinda what I expected from someone I legit thought was retarded.
And I swear to fucking god, if this fat piece of shit keeps calling me garbage,
I’ll put sweepers on his helmet like he’s Marvin the Martian.
I said fuck his size, I’m this high, I’ll kill his style with two bars.
Said even we inside, let’s fist fight til your left eye is f.u.b.a.r.
Oh now your lips dry, can’t spit rhymes, get this guy a cue card.
See you can’t do what I do but I’m pretty sure I’m better at your style than you are.
So what you wanna do, dog? This your funeral, K.
You’re a big fat nervous nail-biting motherfucker; how them cuticles taste?
Dog, y’all really think K’s a gangster with a tool in his waist,
but I’m a real estate agent: you make a move, and I’ll put you in your place.
I keep my cash in a shoebox. No revenue’s in the banks.
I don’t care if money gets locked up, then this dude isn’t safe.
You a counterfeit. A little light behind him will prove that he’s fake,
and y’all can count on me to keep it one hundred until I’m blue in the face.
Yo he does a little thing every time that I rhyme;
I dunno if I’m battling somebody or fucking fighting a fucking mime.
Yeah, I’ma keep it one hundred with y’all.
Anybody this fucking big should not be a coward.
Dog, I don’t know if I’m trying to battle rap somebody
or fucking argue with the bouncer.
Dog, he claims to be a boss that spits fire, but his punches don’t got any power,
so it makes a lot of sense that you and Illmac looked like Mario versus Bowser.
Honestly, I fell asleep through half of your rounds.
I mean if you keep stepping up, I’ma keep backing him down.
But I’m back now, the man they’ve been asking about,
I say fuck Illmaculate, I should be the champion now.

Shut the fuck up. As if you had any doubt.
Dog, if he the man of the house, then I’m grabbing his spouse,
put a gag in her mouth and fucking dragging her out.
I’ll yoke that bitch up while her panties are down
and slide a dick in her ass while I’m tapping her out.
See I’m the dude that live the shit that you be rapping about.
See I don’t normally rap but I had to make an example out of the clown,
look at him, nervous. You can see the sweat damping his brow,
somebody pass him a towel
like Th3 Saga when he’s logging onto his Brazzers account.
It’s in god’s hands now, bitch, what them passwords about?
When we first met, he said, “Fam, you nice, K.”
And I appreciate that, you fake ass Andrew Dice Clay.
Look, straight to the money once I land: two-night stay.
I will pop you cold square in the mouth like a brand new ice tray.
Razor to your face, get severed in cold cuts.
You soft. Peanut butter and jelly with no crust.
A two-piece, then you ‘sleep. I can tell he’a fold up.
Do something. I will smack the gel out your bowl cut.
I grind the whole winter, through the cold and fleece;
I’m blowing sticky like a hippie, holding the piece(peace).
You think you fast as lightning, toe to toe with a beast,
just ‘cause you got a haircut like Travolta in Grease.
What you know about grinding and ducking raids when the feds sweep?
You blow that big ass nose with a bed sheet.

They threw your ass in a shark tank; you dead meat.
You’ll be your homies’ chest piece by the next week.
I talk it ‘cause I live it; you don’t live it to talk it.
Hit the compartment, click it, then I click it and spark it.
Two eights, roommates: they’ll split your apartment.
Enter the gauntlet. This the strongest shit on the market.
This idiot Caustic lost it. He ain’t no type thug.
Get a bright idea, I will break your light bulb.
Make this Italian speak Spanish before I take your life, blood,
‘cause you gon give this floor a kiss, in Beso Nightclub.
Skip the babbling. Before rap, I was in the Radisson.
O.T. with my O.G., really trafficking.
Breaking down, bagging up, clipping, packaging,
and wasn’t stepping up in your spot ‘less I get the ratchet in,
so stick to battling. I hit harder than fifty javelins.
I took Caustic in the Bay ‘cause I’m into traveling.
You need the hometown support; I ain’t really mad at ‘im.
I bring that fire shit to your porch: Billy Madison.
I am sick and fucking tired of them saying Bigg K talks that real shit.
So I think it’s high time I pulled your card, you giant fucking Garbage Pail Kid.
Y’all heard him in the trailer hating. Saying that my angles is a crutch.
But you’re basically saying that you’re not creative enough
to find a specific way to say that I suck.
I mean, you could say the same, but you playing gangster too much,
so here’s a fucking angle for you, K, you tell me if I’m making it up.
So me and you got cool around when you lost -- and I lost --,
so please believe that I meant that shit when I called us homies.
It’s hard me to stand up here and even call him phony.
But what the sad part is is that my own boys really do not know me.
I lost my dad when I was five. I lost my brother when I was eight.
I lost a couple homies this year, I just had to shoulder the weight.
I don’t even blink no more, dog, this shit happens every day,
but y’all keep trying to make this battle rap shit real.
Man, this battle rap shit is my escape.
Man, it’s because all you fucking battle cats are fake.
Acting like you don’t got an emotional side.
Honestly dog,
I think about my dead homies every morning the second I open my eyes.
So if I ever fucking push you away or act different then don’t be surprised;
I do it for your own good, K, ‘cause everybody close to me dies.
I remember back in the day when I didn’t have any rights.
In and out of group homes and jail for over half of my life.
Before I was taking this battle rap shit to new heights
I was taking baby steps because my shackles was too tight.
So nowadays everybody acts like it’s cool to be a criminal with wealth.
But every time you rap I just hear a bunch of bars about you snitching on yourself.
Dog, a lot of people know me from outside of this shit.
Including you, K. And you know I don’t like to glorify the type of lifestyle that I live,
I mean I never did this shit to be cool. I was just trying to provide for my kid,
‘cause if he needed it
I would honestly give him the lung straight from inside of my ribs.
But this guy. This guy. Man this guy isn’t it.
You serve dime bags and shit. You don’t understand breaking pies into zips
and trying to add just the right amount of cut to maximize what you get.
Dog, you don’t know that feeling when the five-o pulls up alongside of your whip,
and he’s giving you the eye because you’re higher than shit,
hiding your sweat ‘cause you’re three deep in the deep East
and you got a trunk with a disconnected Alpine full of bricks.
And you think your little fucking rap lines gonna hit?
There’s nothing you can say to me.
I will let you walk a mile in my shoes just so you’re a mile a-fuckin-way from me.
So for those that don’t know me, this some shit you’ve never heard before.
I keep that part of my life separate because I prefer to work alone.
You try to dig your little dirt but I am cleaner than a germaphobe,
and you about to get so much work I should’ve hit you from my burner phone.
I’ve met all my heroes. And they all say I’m the dude.
You just write a bunch of shit you saw in movies and you fake like it’s true.
I didn’t bring you all the way to San Jose just so I could play-fight with you,
this ain’t no viral pity party like fuckin Daylyt and Oops.
So I bet you sound real cool to them little kids that never struggled,
but I just wanted to reminded you what you sound like
to those of us that really hustle.
Daniel take your pick: revolver or a slice,
I got the hammer and the pick, like I’m carving out of ice.
See I could bar you to death, but that’ll hardly be a fight,
so I’ma use this third round to talk about your life.
You brought me to your house. Say that isn’t facts.
You got a grown man roommate. Just two dudes, kicking back.
That don’t mean they licking sacks, that ain’t what I’m getting at,
but they got a fucking kitty cat. Dog, what type of shit is that?
But I guess when you’re Mr. Disrespect, that’s how you do things.
Walk around Oakland with a cat on a shoestring.
Got the nerve to talk crazy and be kicking that wild shit.
Knowing that your living room smell like Meow Mix.
You kiss that cat in the mouth, and put it in your purse.
Before you allowed to eat, you gotta make his dinner first.
You on Twitter popping off like you gon get at Surf.
You feeling Evil ‘cause you pen a verse stroking Mr. Bigglesworth.
I will Petey Pablo that little shit, it stinks.
Skin it alive and sew a fucking midget mink.
You in the house overflowing your kitchen sink,
struggling trying to give a bath to Mister Jinx.
How you a stray pet back tickler but yet he raps sinister?
You tried to trace a day in my steps, you’d snap fibulae.
Fuck these racist fans that say we rap similar;
I bark with the big dogs. You a cat whisperer.
It pisses in your bed. Made you buy an extra sheet.
It purrs on your chest while you cry yourself to sleep.
You’s a motherfucking girl. You done made your choice,
and you battle ‘cause it’s the only time you get to raise your voice.
So stop lying like you mean. You fronting, that isn’t facts.
Ain’t hustling in the rap or running in with a strap.
Next time y’all hear Caustic thugging up in his raps,
just picture him and his roommate on the couch, cuddled up with a cat.
New York I'm back, fresh off of bodying Prep, did y'all miss me?
I heard Danny get punch drunk in bar fights, leavin niggas all tipsy.
So I'm supposed to be scared to let the BarGod get me?
Well, call me the BarDevil.
‘Cause what I say tend(Satan) to hit and you'll loose if a(Lucifer) bar miss me.
This what gets me. He aiight. Good bars, nice performance.
But y'all amp em like a champion. Y’all treat him like he Michael Jordan.
Well I'ma put you in this plain(plane) black box, like a flight recording;
Ay, ARP…I hope this nigga got life insurance.
‘Cause tonight we warring. I don't care if it's a gat by ya,
I'll aim the nine, flame his spine: that's when it back-fired.
He'll hit the ground, then I'll stand over that clown like "I did you bad, Myers",
And be the nigga he looking up to, since I’m who he ad-mires.
Now if there was a billboard, for overhyped battlers, you would be in that ad, Myers,
You said you punch in 90% of your bars… but use 2 bar setups, hmm…
Can you add, Myers?
Well I'ma bag Myers. Homie sound pathetic on wax,
I'll run up in his studio, you could bet that I'm strapped,
Open the door to the booth and throw lead in your back,
Now that's my way, of stopping a nigga dead in his tracks.
Matter fact, I gotta right(write) for you. Come and get this hook from me.
Sidenote: you look ugly.
And how you never got paid for these battles you book, dummy?
Now trust me, I'm good money.
Homie you Shang Tsung: tryna be the sole(soul) owner of a style you took from me,
this crook funny.
He brought the D.A. to(2) NY, so I waited ’til his ride came thru,
jumped in the V, and made ‘em C K’s between his two I's,
and left shells beside they shoes,
now two bars ago, I spelled his fuckin name out…
and you know it, ‘cause you got the mind frame to,
but what you probably didn’t notice is in the bar after that,
I spelled your wife’s name too.
This what I do. The burner hold rounds like a Discmaker.
Get Black buried over games like it’s Brick Breaker.
You got me in my old Zone, that's big Danja.
Machete chop em at the watch; I’m a wrist-taker.
They mistake this kid for a mad scientist,
Dr. Jekyll, with a split personality but I Hyde the shit.
You pussy. Open this vagina lips you’ll find a clit.
This is light, but seeing son die’ll(sundial) show niggas what time it is.
And why insist I got my style from a son, nigga? Jones is smart.
I ain’t falling for that stunt, so how niggas figure I’m Owen Hart?
I came to set this bitch on fire, like Joan of Ark.
On the poll he in (Napoleon) the lead,
but I’m breaking every bone apart (Bonaparte).
I know I'm sharp. On a one to ten scale I'm a fuckin million,
I’m something brilliant. Battle rap's Russell Wilson,
but not ‘cause I'm destined to be a legend after big moves to come,
but ‘cause even though I see errors(Ciara’s) in my present,
I’ll be fathering the Future, son.
Now shoot your gun. It’s lights out if I blow the flame.
A shot in your mouth’ll numb your jaw like novocaine.
In Phoenix, you told Chaz you brought that “Ch” to “AZ”.
Well I shouldn’t have to load and aim and let that toaster bang
to show you my “Ch” illa, you know the name.
I control the game. So you might’ve battled dudes who sound like me,
But you ain’t never stood in front of three rounds like these. Bosstown.
I was reading an article about you, it said Chilla Jones top pen.
And I can't even tell you the rest, 'cause I stopped then.
I mock men, “screep” up on him 'cause his people wildin' out,
then plug in the back of his head like Neo dialing out.
Him beating me? Nigga keep dreaming. You just gon keep scheming.
Before there was Scheme Street, me and my niggas was in the streets scheming.
Streets fiending to see two beast demons’ damn writing.
We lock horns like rams fighting. I'm fast enough to can lightning.
I should let the hands strike em, open palm like I'm slap boxing.
This is when Bruce Lee was fighting Chuck Norris with the cat watching.
Rap’s his profession; I had to invest in a Crack option.
Seven shots in rapid succession from a black Dotson.
Chilla be pointing niggas out in the crowd: he Matlock-ing.
He better make sure he lock his Holmes, I’m a black Watson.
I swear, I'm from where there were no necks they spared.
The night was illuminated by the tecs they flared.
Ironically, due to lack of male(mail) in the house,
niggas had to grow up overnight or get next day aired.
Chilla’s a snitch, real shit, so when I cock it, he's a corpse.
I don’t care if I’m with my kids and he's spotted from the porch.
Those coke sales were plotted from my thoughts.
How I get that Benz? He know, (Benzino), Boston cops got it from the Source.
You’re getting your career stretched; you ain't nowhere near vet.
This tough act I ain't worried about, that gun talk is mere threats.
I got a gun so big...that when I catch you,
I gotta let you slide, 'cause the train it's on ain't even here yet.
Fear death. Slugs push and leave a thug shook.
That mini gun got me walking like I was born with a clubbed foot.
Bitch nigga my whole mob stunting, everyone of 'em five dumping;
paramedics'll have to use pressure and apply everywhere like they job hunting.
I know Boston got gangs, but I ain't tripping 'cause im toy popping.
Throw them sets up. We ride through and pick at (picket) signs like we boycotting.
I'm doing you how a Boss should do; this gon be a loss for you.
They can't keep this puncher in a cage;
you know how much that would cost a zoo? (Kostya Tszu)
I'll give him that two jab concussion.
Its not the college in Boston when I give you mass (U. Mass) destuction.
Let me catch him with the mother of his child. You gon see him stretched.
First I'll lock up king pen, then ya B.M. F’ed.
But run up on me, you'll receive the biggest reception.
Bullets'll change your facial features when you witness protection.
I'm the truth, bitch. I'll grab the A.K. and get his roof split.
I'm accurate with them sticks like Rain Man with the toothpicks.
My nines peel. Every one of my lines real;
the way we'll bust Jerome you'll think we on Heinz field.
This strap is like when a girl invites you to watch Netflix,
‘cause when I add extensions,
bullets coming over to Chill with bad intentions.
You've made rash decisions, and you on the ground with this shit.
This wack emcee got another 2 rounds of this shit. Yikes!
So you told Danja, "being from the west and killing the east is what I encompass.”
And you call yourself a fuckin writer?
I mean that was a dope concept, but poor execution.
I would've thought of something tighter.
Like every round, I end(N) on top, and leave niggas right on E.
If you ever say I lost you’s a fuckin liar.
How could you rank me at the bottom, S-pecially when every battle I left with the W,
‘cause my schemes encompass fire?
Myers, this battle is your test. Let’s see if you can make it out.
If you pass, this could be 2015's greatest bout,
but if you fail, I’ll put a blade through your stomach, and take your navel out.
Get caught cheating, I'ma hold it against you like a faithful spouse,
then slice your shit. Then give you the replay pronto,
Killer Instinct with punches: I’m T.J. Combo.
Two cans, for you and your man, if he say dram, bro,
I’m clicking on y’all both like a three-way convo.
My squad gon get it in,
and you’a hear, more gunshots during this round than Jon Dough editing.
Steppin into your trapspot. Them glocks, we make it clap,
so guard all the buddha y'all weigh, or we takin that.
God, Allah, Buddha, Yahweh — that’s a divine scheme.
I had to make it clear for my pupil like Visine.
My team? It's a lot of us, don't bother us,
I’m trying to help this square get the picture like monitors,
so watch your men or a(menora) flame lighting like Hanukkah.
They lift your sole(soul) then shoo’ with the hammer like cobblers.
Watch how fast the room’a (rumor) spread like gossipers,
once shots sail on your shirt like Nautica.
Taking me was Gothika: a very wrong plan,
just a scary movie made to get buried(Berry) on cam,
damn. What you expected? Accept it, I'm spectacular,
You’ll get put in a coffin, Danny, the next Dracula.
Now bar for bar you think you the best battler,
the king author(Arthur)? ‘Cause you handled X caliber?
Or ‘cause it took your 3 best rounds to compete with Danja’s?
Well everything I’m speaking cold(code); that's a secret language.
My main bitch, she don't act like a lady.
Come at me sideways if you want. She'll be clappin that 80,
if his direct at me(hysterectomy), she ain’t having it, baby.
Now.. If y’all don’t know what a hysterectomy is, just wait it out,
the next two, I’ma explain what the wordplay's about.
You took me and Danja back to back. You the bravest scout.
Thought you was pussy. I ain't expect you to risk(uterus) being taken out.
Invade his house. From any angle I'm certain to kill shit.
Show you how to arc a tec: I'm the person to build with.
If it's beef and you the cause, B,(Cosby) I’m lurking to peel(pill) shit.
Mentally, I'm plain(plane) sick with a terminal illness;
This is realness. They say I lost to DNA. They had me wrong,
that was a bag, just over heads, but carry on.
Soon as I clap he gone, nigga the Bloque is riders.
Let you name a Top 5.... You ain’t a starter, Myers.
This is stardom, Myers. Y'all brought a star to Myers,
for his career to die in New York like Stoudamire’s?
I spark and fire, them cans get dumped, them hands could bump,
your back left with random lumps like camel humps;
Danny we could let it “bow” in the ring, but why handle guns?
When it’s Karate, kid, I’ll kick punches to get Daniel sonned.
You already know you on the ground with this shit.
This wack emcee got a whole nother round of this shit. Yikes.
Your whole career, niggas complained about that boring shit.
Well I could give him nine to five, that'll make his whole morning shift.
Usually got the P89 with me, but if we get into a slug fest,
I’ma use the homie P like I'm trying to pass a drug test.
The iron'll squeeze.
You Mark Wahlberg: by the time you realize what's happening, you'll die in a breeze.
Bitch, I'll shoot your mama and your daddy. I’m creeping up where their home is.
Bullets gon out do em, they keeping up with the Joneses.
I gave your bitch my bottle of Henny; I bend these hoes.
She sucked me in the front seat of yo car; again she bold.
She swallowed Dan Brown, so when I made her moan,
a least a ho let me nut all over the Vin; she cold. (Da Vinci code)
It’s Mortal Kombat when they get me.
'Cause they never see the punches coming at ‘em like Kenshi.
But back to your bitch. That tramp is a Boston skeezer.
They said her head is past a ten, that's why I went off to meet her (off the meter).
Your mixtape? Wack as fuck! Not a single song I ain't feel once.
I'll raise a arm here (hair) if y'all like the songs that Chill bumps.
I'm too cold. I got a crazy maggie.
And five other small ones, but I really only fuck with two of ‘em like a baby daddy.
I'll run up and pop the chrome.
The first thing his man'll do is
pick him up and look at the face like when you drop your phone.
We’ll get guns you could hold in your hand, and some you carry over.
Then we'll surround this nigga spot like a areola.
You'll get buried soldier. Every day I'm carrying chrome.
My aura exudes to you a nefarious tone.
You get with bitches online, then you carry them home.
We ran track meets on the bitch who's marryin' (Marion) Jones.
You took my punches and mixed em with your schemes,
and you don't see nothing wrong about it.
I gave you power! I'll pull this gun and Nas'll write a song about it!
Banana clip hanging out of the K, you gon meet with shots.
You'll see this half moon in the middle of the day; that's a Equinox.
You think the beefing stops? I'll break your face in seconds.
Gun butt you til the stock destroyed. Your family be in a great depression.
Let me catch you with your homeboy. I real quick burst toolies.
You'll be sleeping with your man like Will Smith first movie.
I'm cold as Six Degrees; this the Separation before the tool peel.
Steel click (still clique) like when you break up with a bitch but y'all cool still.
Don't be a fool Chill, you coming at me with this rookie shit.
You seen how many niggas on cam I to'
from all the weak rhymes them pussies print.
Cam I to', camel toe, that's a reach, but that's the thing I'm slangin’.
But then again, when you reaching with the pussy that's finger bangin’.
You'll see my finger bangin', head shot; when they seen it, his men skirted.
The right stick have him thinking up is down like he inverted.
But yo! Guess who got shot in the dome piece?
Jerome's niece on her way home from Jones beach.
I'm Illmatic, and you on the ground with this shit;
this wack emcee got a whole nother round of this shit. Yikes!
I paid JC 600 dollars. Made a classic. Shit’s straight perfect.
You paid Rex twelve racks. For one fire round and two mixtape verses,
I mean, twelve racks? I mean, I'll never call you a cheap bastard,
but we all know, all you want in this game is elite status,
But for twelve racks? You could’ve battled Daylyt, Big Kannon and B. Magic
and traded that one weak battle for three classics, but lemme ask this:
where the fuck, was your manager, when you thought about this stupid plan?
How the fuck was paying Rex twelve racks supposed to improve your brand?
Yeah, you'se a man, with ten kids, but this is where you lose as a father,
‘cause do you know what twelve racks could do for a son or do for a daughter?
That's groceries for a year. That money coulda kept food in the fridge.
That's four months rent, plus furniture. Something new for the crib.
That's Disneyland for the summer, somethin special for you and your kid.
That's emergency money, in case you end up doin a bid,
but you ain't put your fam first. You gave that money to Rex.
You never paid dues, you paid dudes for your fuckin respect.
I don’t take it as disrespect when niggas ask me where my style is at,
‘cause I’d rather spend that money making sure my child’s intact.
This is real shit. Could give a fuck if the crowd react,
but I'm the motherfuckin KingPen, Danny.
It’s time to show you why they crowned me that.
Today’s your burial. I’m the KingPen, your games imperial,
I'm fuckin sick. It ain’t venereal. You ain’t ready, bro.
Homie I ain’t horsin’ around, this ain’t a merry-go.
Give his Pops Smacks over checks(Chex), it ain’t a cereal.
Rounds coming out of these cans, they ain’t spaghetti o’s;
I flip and catch bodies in the ring like Rey Mysterio.
Think a stereo: I could set(cassette) it on Danny and make a tool pop.
I got a new ox(AUX), and see these(CD’s) weapons gonna make dude stop.
I’m the type to come to your funeral as the tomb drop,
and throw dynamite in your casket. Now it’s a boombox.
Let him park on the strip while I'm standing on the rooftop.
He get stretched, pulling up under these caps like tube socks.
I’m too hot. This is haymakers and quick jabs.
They said you’d never take a loss to me(colostomy);
now you getting your shit bagged.
I’ll have goons pull up dumping hammers with crip rags,
and just for my amusement, park, repping them Six flags.
So get mad. Scream, nigga. Run around the whole stage.
You’ll probably be the first battler to die of old age.
I outline everybody. Then they disappear with no trace.
When I bare(beer) cans and hit his six pack, that’s a cold case.
Twin four-fours, that belong together like soulmates,
I let ‘em point, and scream out the window like road rage.
Toast blaze. Hella chrome, clicking like a metronome,
can to his ear like kids playing telephone.
Newsflash: We ran through your wife, and we was getting dome.
We was training that tongue better than Rosetta Stone.
Your last battle? 2-1 classic, I gave the edge to Zone.
‘Cause with a nigga like Danja, you can't just squeeze past em, you need action.
You gotta put that K in front of Carter. If he reverse then retrack him,
then keep blackin, wait. Most of y'all ain't even peep that.
Put a K in front of Carter, then reverse it, it spells retrack.
But I’ma relax. I’m only here to slump my next victim.
Y’all really thought he could overcome my best writtens?
Think Fetty Wap, he bout to be the one I(eye) left missing.
‘cause living? You can’t here(hear) Danny, this a death(deaf) mission,
I'm a vet spittin. What you know about the game?
Jones rounds insane, make him scream his slogan out in pain.
Your death tonight and Bobbi Kristina’s both about the same,
‘cause this was suicide, and now your life is going down the drain.
The crown remains with the KingPen, and that's why you losing now,
against Mister Jump-to-Top-Tier-from-the-Proving-Grounds. Bosstown.
This nigga’s a false prophet. I felt he was a villain with a hunch.
That's why I'm coming to Jones town to kill him with a punch.
After this, you ain't doing no more battles.
The silhouette of my gun should’ve been a fore(four)shadow.
Chilla’s a workin man; I'll run up in his damn office.
Blow off both his legs; I come across stand offish.
You dead here. You gone be a martyr to your daughter.
This cat suited to be a pussy like Cheetara.
I'll call you a hoe holding a sword. Your skin, I’ll get under that.
This lion'll (Lionel) leave you in a West Brook.
That's how you scheme with the Thundercat.
You fuckin’ wack. I'll kidnap you in Boston; I'm really with the schemes.
The silencer won't say a word; you'll really miss the Bean (Mister Bean).
My team real. Can't no fuckin' man scare us.
Gun out the guitar case if you flashing a band, dare us. (Banderas)
I'm from a damn era where rap words got a rival shot.
Big L was still spittin', and Big Pun had the goggles cocked.
Souls of Mischief was banging from every car ride,
and west coast lyricists was trying to make it to the far side. (Pharcyde)
But here we are, god. Top pen games, you'll get your body burned.
Niggas ain't seen a better writer since Tommy Hearns.
As far as I'm concerned, this fag I gots to snipe.
This bitch just doesn't get it like Magic Johnson wife.
The irony in that line’s crazy! They thought we was the same,
but I'm the only sick one, even though we're contracted to let blood exchange.
Fuck Boss Town, I'll ride through your city and provide hecklers.
You'll see 22 coming out the Blazer like Clyde Drexler.
I'll side step ya. Break you off with a couple of rights.
I talk to niggas, you better come at a Brother polite (Polight).
I'd never run from a fight. I gave it all I had;
if a nigga want to get me to (meter) running he better call a cab.
I'll put you in a Boston crab, then let the choppa spit.
I'll put a hole, inside of this hoe, that's the size of a whole lotta shit.
Drama shit. He want a war, now we want a war.
But if all my niggas came in Chevys, how could you think we on one accord?
Daylyt started the schemes and you stole it. You a damn smoker.
I write scripts for niggas who bite: I'm Bram Stoker.
I'll hand choke ya. I ain't the one you should call out, boy.
You'll get rocked with metal ’til you fall out, boy.
You think I give a fuck about that 12k? I hustle, nigga; I see paper.
Keanu Reeves hit my phone 'cause he heard I was the Key Maker.
But you come up with all these genius schemes to set fire to yo raps.
I had to open up them bricks, then set fire to the wraps.
This nigga Myers fittin to snap on this nerd geek, word freak,
nigga get on. Writers Bloque the only block you ever been on.
Listen Scrap, skip the raps on how your fifth'll clap.
These pussies only act animated 'cause I’m a risk to cats.(aristocats)
It’s a difference, black. This notepad is my home.
In this battle shit, I’m the baddest guy known.
I honed him in on the fifth floor. So if Jerome’s in the house,
we’ll catch him by his window, drag and fly (Dragonfly) Jones.
Little fag I fly chrome. And you on the ground with this shit;
thank the lord he don't got another round of this shit. Yikes!
